<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p class="normal">This Paper is the result of work carried on by Mr. Means as a
graduate student in the Division of Anthropology during the years 1915-1917. It
consists mainly of translations of early Spanish books and manuscripts.</p>
<p class="normal">It is gratifying to note that this is the first publication by
the Museum based upon the large collection of photographic reproductions of early
manuscripts from Mexico and Central America brought together by Professor W. E.
Gates of Point Loma, California, and presented to the Museum by Mr. Charles P. Bowditch.
Among these manuscripts is Avendaño&#39;s account of his journey to Peten, the greater
part of which is included in the present paper. The original of this manuscript
is in the British Museum. Cano&#39;s account of a trip to Guatemala is also given here.
This manuscript is in the Brinton Collection at the University of Pennsylvania.
It is through the kindness of Dr. George B. Gordon, Director of that Museum, and
of Miss Adela C. Breton, who copied the manuscript, that it is possible to publish
it at this time. The Avendaño and the Cano manuscripts were translated by Mr. Bowditch
and Señor G. Rivera.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="normal">In the library of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University there
is an invaluable collection of photographs of old manuscripts relating to Middle
America. These photographs, made by Professor William E. Gates of Point Loma, California,
were given to the Peabody Museum by Charles P. Bowditch, Esq., of Boston. One of
the volumes contains a photographic reproduction of an original manuscript entitled
<i>Relación de las dos Entradas que hizé a Peten Ytza</i>. The author, Fray Andrés de
Avendaño y Loyola, of the Order of Saint Francis, will receive much of our attention
later. Fortunately Mr. Bowditch and Sr. Guillermo Rivera have deciphered and translated
the crabbed old text, so that we have at hand an account of the subjection of the
Itzas of Tayasal, or Peten Itza, which is not only invaluable as being the work
of an eyewitness of that subjection, but which also is filled with a rare charm.
It was largely with a view to bringing this old manuscript to the attention of students
that Mr. Bowditch and Dr. Tozzer asked me to work it up into a study of the Itzas
of Tayasal. At the same time we must not neglect to notice here the translation,
made by Mr. Bowditch and Sr. Rivera, of another inedited work on the same subject.
I refer to the account by Fray Alonso Cano, which will be of great use to us later.</p>
<p class="normal">Though Avendaño and Cano are, so to speak, the prime reasons for
the writing of this study, they have been supplemented in no inconsiderable degree
by two other early Spanish writers on the history of Yucatan and its people, Diego
Cogolludo and Juan de Villagutierre y Sotomayor. A few comments on the works of
these two authors will later prove useful to the reader.</p>
<p class="normal">Though Villagutierre&#39;s Spanish style is far superior to that of
such writers as Fernando Montesinos and Antonio de la Calancha, it is, nevertheless,
atrocious. Although he wrote about 1700, Villagutierre&#39;s style is excessively archaic;
his grammatical construction can hardly be called construction at all, so formless
and ambiguous is it. Villagutierre never hesitates to write several long sentences
without a single main verb between them, nor does he often refrain from going on
and on for a page or so without using a period. In the use of capitals he is most
whimsical; usually he has them when they are called for, but he has many that are
out of place as well.</p>
<p class="normal">The style of Cogolludo, on the other hand, is very good, and that,
be it noted, despite the fact that Cogolludo wrote prior to 1688. One remarks with
considerable surprise that in several cases Villagutierre and Cogolludo use almost
the same words. For example, in speaking of the visit which Cortes made to the island
of Tayasal, Cogolludo says: &quot;... <i>y aun la ida de Cortes se tuvo por ossadia, y
demasiada confianza....</i>&quot; Villagutierre, in the same connection says: &quot;... <i>que
lo tenian a grandissima temeridad, y ossadia, y por demasiada confianza....</i>&quot; This
is an interesting point, and perhaps it is significant that Cogolludo&#39;s book was
published in 1688, whereas that of Villagutierre was not brought out until 1701.
It is to be noted that Cogolludo, the earlier writer, uses only two epithets, and
that Villagutierre, the later writer, uses the same two, plus a new one of his own.
I know of two other cases where equally close and significant similarity exists
between the two. It is possible, then, that Villagutierre copied (not to say plagiarized)
the work of Cogolludo without giving credit for it. But the important point for
us in this matter does not concern the personal integrity of Villagutierre. Rather
does the importance of the matter lie in this: if Villagutierre was acquainted with
the history of Yucatan by Cogolludo to such a degree that he frequently borrowed
whole phrases from it, he must have had a very good reason for diverging widely
now and again from the version of events given by Cogolludo. Such a reason could
only be supplied by the fact that Villagutierre possessed information which he regarded
as superior to and more official than that of Cogolludo. Therefore, since in several
instances (as in his account of the events leading up to the visit of Cortes to
Tayasal) Villagutierre occasionally departs from the footsteps of Cogolludo, we
may safely assume that he was at once more critical and better informed than the
latter, whom, however, he valued enough to be willing to draw from his work much
of his information and even some of his phraseology.</p>
<p class="normal">The virtues and defects of Avendaño and of Cano are less subtle;
so much so, indeed, that it would be absurd to attempt a criticism of them here.
The reader will have ample opportunity to see their qualities for himself in the
body of the book.</p>
<p class="normal">A word as to the method adopted in translating is in order. In
the various passages taken from Cogolludo and Villagutierre I have preserved the
spelling and capitalization of proper names that appear in the text. All passages
from Avendaño and Cano are from the translations made by Mr. Bowditch and Sr. Rivera.</p>
<p class="normal">All the other works used are so well known that comment on them
is superfluous.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Bowditch and to
Dr. Tozzer, both of whom have spent much time and thought in going over the manuscript
of this work. Among the others who have shown me kindness and courtesy during the
preparation of this study are Mr. Putnam of the Library of Congress; Dr. George
Byron Gordon of the University Museum, Philadelphia; Professor Holmes of the United
States National Museum; Dr. Edward Luther Stevenson of the Hispanic Society of America,
New York; and, lastly, my mother, Mrs. James Means. These and others have generously
given me much of their time and information.</p>

<h3>THE PRECOLUMBIAN HISTORY OF THE MAYAS<br>
AND OF THE ITZAS, 1445</h3>
<p class="continue">In general it may be said that the Maya culture occupied the
peninsula of Yucatan, portions of the states of Tabasco and Chiapas in Mexico, Guatemala,
and the northern part of Honduras. That branch of the Mayas who called themselves
the Itzas and who form the chief subject of this work occupied the southern portion
of Yucatan and the greater part of what is now the Department of Peten in Guatemala.</p>
<p class="normal">A few decades ago it was the fashion to credit the aboriginal peoples of America
with a civilization of enormous antiquity. But the whole trend of modern scientific
investigation tends to prove that the American continent was one of the last parts
of the world to be settled and that, at the time of the Spanish conquest, the aboriginal
cultures were certainly not more than three thousand or so years old. Even this
estimate should be understood to include centuries of migratory shiftings and centuries
of development along lines which eventually led to the erection of the earlier types
of high culture in Middle and South America. Roughly speaking, the time of Christ
coincides with the period at which the earliest high cultures in this hemisphere
began to flourish.</p>
<p class="normal">For the sake of convenience we shall follow the chronology suggested
by Mr. Morley (1915) and divide the pre-Columbian history of the Maya race into
eight periods. The first seven of these periods we shall discuss briefly in this
opening chapter; the eighth will furnish the subject matter for the remainder of
the book. The dates given should be regarded as merely approximate.</p>

<p class="normal">Before taking
up our review of the first seven periods we must remind ourselves that the prehistoric
cultures of Middle America have a certain unity, showing beyond doubt that they
were all of a common origin. It is impossible to tell at what epoch the Maya became
separate and distinct from the other highly cultured peoples scattered over Mexico
and Central America. Fortunately, however, owing to the investigations in the Valley
of Mexico, we have abundant material for the reconstruction of the sequence of cultures.
Three successive strata of occupation have been found in the Valley of Mexico. The
earliest of these, the Archaic, is also found in many other places throughout Mexico
and Central America. There is some reason to suppose that this culture was at one
time fairly uniform throughout the greater part of Middle America. The local developments
seen in the Maya, the Zapotec, and the early Mexican cultures may have been the
result of modifications of the Archaic culture. Above this Archaic stratum in the
Valley of Mexico is found the Toltec or Teotihuacan culture. This is synchronous
with late Maya of the sixth period on our table. Manifestations of its art are found
in the latest buildings at Chichen Itza. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>I. Migratory Period</b> (?-200 A.D.). The two earliest dated Maya
inscriptions that we have are those on the Tuxtla statuette and on the Leyden plate.
(Morley, 1915, p. 194 ff.; Holmes, 1916.) The former is dated, in the Maya system
of chronology, 8.6.2.4.17. (about 100 B.C.); the date on the latter is 8.14.3.1.12.
(about 50 A.D.).<a name="div2Ref_1.1" href="#div2_1.1"><sup>1.1</sup></a> Although, as Mr. Morley points out, these are the earliest dates
we know of from the Maya area, it is to be noted that they do not differ essentially
from the more recent inscriptions. They ought, therefore, to be regarded as introductory
to the historic period, and it may be assumed that they were themselves preceded
by many decades of development during which the first attempts at writing were gradually
elaborated until the extremely complex Maya hieroglyphics were evolved in the form
in which we know them. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>II. The Golden Age or Old Empire of the Maya</b> (200-600 A.D.).
This period extended, roughly, from 9.2.10.0.0. (210) to 10.2.0.0.0. (600). In this
time many cities rose, flourished, and fell. Of these Palenque, Yaxchilan, Piedras
Negras, Tikal, Seibal, Quirigua, Copan, and Nakum are some of the more important.
Like Seibal on the east and Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan on the west, Tikal and
Nakum were not far from the Peten region to which our attention will be chiefly
directed.<a name="div2Ref_1.2" href="#div2_1.2"><sup>1.2</sup></a> Indeed, Lake Peten lies in what is almost the geographical center of
the area formerly occupied by the Old Empire. It is significant, therefore, that
Mr. Morley has found at the modern town of Flores (in Lake Peten) two stelae dated
approximately 10.1.0.0.0. and 10.2.0.0.0. (580 and 600).</p>
<p class="normal">The various elaborate architectural
features of the Old Empire cities have been fully examined by many writers, and
it is, therefore, needless for us to speak of them except in the most general terms.
One predominating feature of all the ruins is the excessive use of ornamentation.
Because the country was devoid of any great natural elevations which would give
an effective setting for their buildings, the people often used substructures of
varying heights and superstructures of several sorts. If one may judge from the
sculptures left by the inhabitants of the early cities, their life was mainly taken
up with an extremely involved ritualistic religion which, in the hands of a priestly
body, was at once the means by which they were ruled and the outlet for the artistic
gifts which they undeniably had. Very probably the over-elaborate religion was responsible
for the tremendous mass of detail to be seen in so many of the ruined cities. So
great was the eagerness for space upon which to crowd ornamentation that an architectural
feature which served no purpose other than that of affording more ample space for
decoration was evolved. The roof-comb is found in a high degree of development at Yaxchilan and elsewhere. (Spinden, 1913, p. 112, fig. 148.) Sometimes, as at Tikal,
this cumbersome construction was carried to such lengths that the area covered by
walls was out of all natural proportion to that covered by rooms.</p>
<p class="normal">One can only conjecture
what brought about the downfall of these ancient cities in which a very advanced
culture once flourished. It is not impossible that the priesthood became so oppressive
that an emigration took place; or, owing to a lack of proper agricultural knowledge,
the fields probably became spent so that the people were forced to seek new homes;
possibly also there was some sort of an invasion from the west or east. Any one
or all of these causes may have brought about the succeeding period, one which lies
within and at the end of the Golden Age. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>III. The Colonization Period</b> (450-700 A.D.). This period is
chiefly notable for us because it marks the beginning of documentary history and
because the Itzas are first specifically mentioned in connection with it.<a name="div2Ref_1.3" href="#div2_1.3"><sup>1.3</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal">About
450 Ziyan Caan or Bakhalal was built, to be occupied only some sixty years. (Spinden,
1913, Table 2; Brinton, 1882, Chr. I.) According to Chronicle V the use of the name
Itza dates from the founding of Chichen Itza, an event which took place about 510.<a name="div2Ref_1.4" href="#div2_1.4"><sup>1.4</sup></a>
At this time there also occurred important changes in the calendar system, an event
symbolized in the Chronicles by the phrase &quot;Pop was set in order.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">There is, then,
in this period of colonization, a well-defined migration northward. The ancient
cities in the south did not die out at once, and we may suppose that the sixth century
of our era was a time of great cultural activity. It is interesting to know that
the old Maya culture and the Tiahuanaco culture (the two greatest American civilizations)
were probably in part at least contemporaries. (Cf. Means, 1917.)</p>
<p class="normal">The Chronicles
are vague and divergent on the question of how long the first occupation of Chichen
Itza lasted. Chronicle I says 120 years; Chronicle II says 200; Chronicle III says
240. As two of the three important Chronicles place the length of occupation at
200 years or more, we may assume that it lasted from about 500 to 700 of our era.</p>
<p class="normal">To this period we may confidently attribute some of the structures at Chichen. It
has been shown that the Casa de Monjas at Chichen underwent several periods of construction.
It is what Mr. Thompson has called &quot;Old Chichen,&quot; however, that is most surely associated
with the period we are now discussing. In that portion of the ruins Mr. Thompson
found a lintel dated 10.2.9.1.9. (about 610). As the building in which the lintel
was found is one of a group that is quite distinct from the rest of the ruins, it
may be believed that they all date from the first occupation.</p>
<p class="normal">We have, of course,
no satisfactory data from which to derive an opinion as to the territorial expansion
of the kingdom ruled from Old Chichen (if, indeed, it was ruled from there). Spinden
(1913, p. 201), however, has found ample reason for believing that Xcalumkin, Xlabpak,
Sayil, Kabah, and Tabi were flourishing at this period. Briefly, the presence of
a modified form of the &quot;manikin scepter&quot; and of the stela (both characteristic of
the ancient cities) convinces him that all these places were erected before the
influence of the Old Empire cities had died out. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>IV. Transitional Period</b> (700-1000 A.D.). The Maya-Itza stock
now reëntered upon their migrations. They moved, about 700, to Chakanputum, where
they stayed until about 950. The Chronicles all agree as to the length of time the
Itzas were at Chakanputum. Of this site we know little beyond the fact that Cortes,
when he visited it in 1519, found a large village there.</p>
<p class="normal">Just before the Itzas left
Champoton, or perhaps just after, Uxmal was founded by Ahcuitok Tutul Xiu, who,
according to the tradition, probably came from the west. The lords of this city
were destined to have an important part to play in the history of the Itzas. About
the year 1000 the cities of Uxmal, Chichen, and Mayapan formed a confederation which
has been called the League of Mayapan. After three or four hundred years of unrest
after the disintegration of the Old Empire a New Empire was about to begin its career.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>V. Renaissance or League Period</b> (1000-1200 A.D.). In the Golden
Age or Old Empire the civilization of the Maya race had centered about Lake Peten,
in the extreme south of the peninsula of Yucatan. In the time of the New Empire
the old cities in the south were gradually forgotten and new ones, quite as remarkable,
sprang up in the northern portion of the peninsula. Three cities probably shared
the sovereign power, forming, by their alliance, the celebrated League of Mayapan.
These cities were Uxmal, ruled by the Xiu family, Mayapan, possibly ruled by the
Cocom<a name="div2Ref_1.5" href="#div2_1.5"><sup>1.5</sup></a> family, and Chichen Itza. The latter is, of course, our chief concern;
but as it has been often described we will only say that it may have had, at one
time, as many as one hundred thousand inhabitants and that the culture that throve
there was of a high order.</p>
<p class="normal">The political features of the League of Mayapan are difficult
to describe with accuracy. Each of the three great cities had its ruling family.
Below these was an order of personages called <i>batab</i>, each of whom held and ruled
a portion of the country. The <i>batab</i> stood in much the same relation to the ruler
of the large city as a medieval baron to the king. Doubtless each <i>batab</i>, ruling
from his own city, had a hierarchy of officers under him. Probably Labna, Kabah,
Chacmultun, Sayil, Hochob, Aké, Tihoo, Acanceh, Tinum, Kewick, and all the other
cities in northern Yucatan were once seats of <i>batabs</i> who were more or less intimately
connected with the ruler of one of the three great cities. There was ample machinery
for the administration of justice, and crimes were fittingly punished. Such positions
as the Halach Uinic (Real Man, i.e., king) of Mayapan and the office of batab of
some lesser city usually were inherited according to the rules of primogeniture,
but this custom could, for sufficient cause, be set aside.<a name="div2Ref_1.6" href="#div2_1.6"><sup>1.6</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal"><b>VI. The Period of the Toltec Mercenaries</b> (1200-1450 A.D.).
However much in the dark we may be as to the details of the events which brought
about the downfall of the League of Mayapan, we are in no doubt as to the main causes
of its disruption. Speaking in very general terms, the situation was as follows.
The ruler of Mayapan seems to have been the trouble maker. Becoming ambitious to
extend his power over the other Halach Uinicil, he called in a number of mercenaries
from Mexico. With the aid of these allies the Halach Uinic of Mayapan made himself
master of the whole northern part of Yucatan, but he had to pay a heavy price in
the shape of giving Chichen Itza to his allies.</p>
<p class="normal">During all these troubles the Xius
at Uxmal seem to have preserved a certain amount of independence; certainly as time
went on and as the power of Mayapan became more and more tyrannically oppressive,
the Xius gradually became the champions of the oppressed. It was but natural that
those of the Itza <i>batabs</i> who still remained at Chichen should resent the alien
dominion placed over them. If we may believe Chronicle I, they made at least one
attempt to get back their old power. The discontent of the Itza element of the population,
a discontent always shared in by the Xius at Uxmal, continued to increase during
two hundred and fifty years. In that period Chichen Itza, under the influence of
its Toltec rulers, witnessed its final period of architectural development. The
Ball Court, the Castillo, the Group of the Columns, and other buildings were erected
under Toltec influence. It is easy to recognize and identify the structures of this
period because they are usually distinguished by such features as serpent columns,
<i>tlaxtli</i> or ball courts, Atlantean supports, feathered monsters, and speech scrolls.</p>
<p class="normal">About 1450 the inevitable revolution against the tyranny of the Toltecs took place,
and with it civilization of the highest type came to an end. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>VII. Disintegration</b> (1450-1541 A.D.). Centralized feudalistic
government destroyed, Yucatan fell into a sad plight. Where one or two strong states
had been before there were now a score of weak ones. In the wars of this period
the once great cities of the League were destroyed and abandoned; new and far less
advanced cities were founded to take their place. The remnant of the Xiu family
retired to Mani; the Cocom became lords of Zotuta. Itzamal seems to have become
a sacerdotal state under the dominion of the Chel family. The Itzas, in whom our
chief interest lies, probably withdrew far to the south and founded their power
in the region about Lake Peten. Brinton (1882, p. 25.) gives this list of the small
independent states found by the Spaniards:</p>

<br>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<h2>COGOLLUDO&#39;S ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE<br>
MAYAS AND OF SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMS</h2>
<p class="normal">It is well to present
the account of the pre-Columbian history of the Mayas as given by Cogolludo. It
will be seen to differ greatly from the more scientific view just given, but it
presents points of interest. It will be found in lib. iv, cap. 3.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Neither from
the peoples who populated this Kingdom of Yucatan nor from their ancient Histories
have I been able to find more than I shall say here. In some writings which those
who first learned how to write left behind them, and which are in the native idiom
(which is still used among the Indians), it says that some of the people came from
the East and some from the West. With those who were from the Occident was one who,
as it were, was a Priest of theirs, called <i>Zamna</i>; and they say that he it was
who gave the names by which they are called in that tongue to all the Ports of the
Sea, points of land, estuaries, coasts, and all the regions, sites, mountains (forests),
and all the places of this entire land; and certain it is that it is a thing worthy
of admiration if it was so, for such a division did he make of everything in order
that each spot might be known by its own name that there is scarcely a palm of land
which has not a name in their tongue. The opinion that the settlers came to this
land from the Occident (although they do not know who they were nor how they came)
is in accord with what Padre Torquemada says in his Monarquia Indiana. (Lib. iii,
cap. 13.) This is, That the Teochichimecas, after that terrible battle with the
Huexotzincas, remained lords of the territory of Tlaxcalan, and made peace with
the other nations on account of the fame of that victory of theirs. These Teochichimecas
must needs found their towns and distribute their lands in such a manner that they
were constantly increasing their power and gradually occupying the country in such
a way that in a little more than 300 years they had spread through the greater part
of New Spain from one coast on the North to the other on the South, a territory
which includes all the inland regions which are to the East, and especially those
of this province of Yucathan as far as the province of Hibueras or Honduras. From
this it seems that the Yucatecs are descended from Chichimec and Aculhua families
which, coming from the West by way of the stopping-places told of by Father Torquemada
in his first books, settled New Spain.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;If from the Orient came other peoples who
settled in this land, there is among the people now there neither tradition nor
writing telling with certainty from whence they came nor what people they were,
although, however, it is said (by some) that they came from the Island of Cuba.
Difficulty arises now, for some came from some regions and others from very different
ones, yet all speak a very ancient tongue, nor has there been any information saying
that any other has existed in the land. But this might have been occasioned by some
tribes being more numerous than others, or by reason of war, or by trade and communication
which, by strengthening the relations of the one race with the other, may have caused
the idiom, usages, and customs of those who were of the greatest number to prevail
over and obliterate those of the less numerous people. From the very differences
which exist between the Yucatec tongue and the Mexican, it seems that the Settlers
of this land must have been they who came from the East; and they may even have
been the most ancient people since the Indian Zamna who came with them was he who
first gave names to the places and lands, as has been told already, for if the others
had been the first, they would have done so. Padre Lizana says the opposite because,
first calling attention to the fact that these Indians call the East <i>Cenial</i>, and
the West, <i>Nohnial</i>, the first of which signifies Small Descent and the second Large
Descent, he says: &#39;And it is a fact that they relate that from the East descended
upon this land a small race and from the West a large one; and by that phrase do
they understand little and much, East and West, few from the one, many from the
other.&#39; The Reader will judge which seems to him the better.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;This land of Yucathan,
which the natives of it call <i>Maya</i>, was governed for a long time by a Supreme Lord,
and the last descendant of these Lords was Tutul Xiu, he who was Lord of Mani and
its neighborhood when, voluntarily, he came to do homage, making himself a friend
of the Spaniards on the day of San Ildefonso, 1541, as has been told. Thus it appears
that there has ever been in the land a Monarchical government which, according to
the most weighty opinion among Writers, is the best for the conservation of Realms.
This King had for the capital of his Monarchy a very populous City called Mayapan
(from which must have been derived the name of this land, Maya); this capital, through
wars and discords between the King and his vassals, and because justice lay only
in the greatest power among them (unhappy the times in which the Supreme Lord has
not a power equal to his justice), this government came to an end; many of the Lords
and Caciques rebelled, each dominating the greatest amount of land he could, and
being always engaged in continuous wars; thus the Spaniards found them (divided
into estates, like Dukes and Counts, albeit without recognizing any Superior). When
Yucathan was left entirely without a Supreme Lord, then the ambition of private
persons who united their forces and banded together to effect their will, resulted
in their ordering the destruction of the City of Mayapan, Capital of the Kingdom;
they demolished it about the year of Our Lord fourteen hundred and twenty (according
to the computation of the ages [_Ahaus?_] of the Indians) and about the 260th year
of their establishment. By this rebellion he who was King and Supreme Lord of all
Yucathan was left only with the Lordship of Mani whither he retired upon the destruction
of the City of Mayapan which was where now are to be seen the ruins of buildings,
near the Village of Telchaquillo. They left him with this small power partly because
of the fidelity of those vassals who did not deny him obedience due, and partly
because of the permission given by the rebels who knew that he had not now more
strength than any of themselves....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;When the Lords of the City of Mayapan were
ruling all the land was tributary to them. The tribute was in small cotton mantles,
native fowl, some cacao in those places where it was got, and a resin which served
as incense in the Temples, and all told it was very small in quantity. All the citizens
and dwellers who lived within the City of Mayapan were free from tribute; and in
the city all the nobles of the land had houses; and by the year 1582 (in which was
written the relation from which all this is drawn) it is said that all those who
were held to be Lords and nobles of Yucathan still remembered, in that place, their
old lots. Now with the change of government and because of the slight estimation
in which they are held ... the descendants of Tutul Xiu, who was King and by right
natural Lord, if they do not work with their hands at labor, have nothing to eat,
and toil does not now seem to them unworthy of consideration. In ancient times,
the nobles of Mayapan were wont to serve in the Temples of the Idols in the ceremonies
and feasts which were by right assigned to them, assisting by day and by night;
and though many themselves had vassals, they recognized the Supreme Lord, and served
him in his wars.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They who dwelt without the City and in the rest of the Province
were vassals and tributaries, not being of those who had houses there in the capacity
of land-holders; but they were greatly favored by their Lords because they themselves
served them as Advocates looking out for their welfare with great solicitude whenever
anyone asked that it be so. They (the vassals and tributaries) were not obliged
to live in assigned Villages since they had license to live and to marry with whomsoever
they wished; the object of this was to ensure multiplication, for they said that
if the people were hampered, there could not fail to result a diminution. Lands
were held in common, and so between the Villages there were no boundaries or landmarks
to divide them; although it is true that between one Province and another because
of wars, save some fields for sowing fruit-bearing trees and land which had been
bought for some purpose of improvement [incomplete sentence in the Spanish]. Also
the salt-works which are on the Shores of the Sea were held in common, and those
who dwelt nearest to them were wont to pay tribute to the Lords of Mayapan with
salt which they had got....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Lords were absolute in power and caused their orders
to be executed with severity. There were Caciques placed in the Villages, or some
other leading person to hear suits and public demands. This officer received the
litigants or disputants, heard the cause of their coming, and, if the matter were
a grave one, talked it over with the Lord. In order to try the case, other Ministers
were appointed who were like Advocates and Constables and who always attended in
the presence of the judges.... They were not in the habit of writing down the lawsuits,
although they had characters (of which many are to be seen in the ruins of their
buildings). All was set forth in words by means of the Ministers before referred
to, and what was then and there determined remained valid and permanent without
either of the parties venturing to work against it. But if the affair which was
to be tried concerned many, they had a great meeting of all the interested together;
then the gist was communicated, upon which followed the decision of the matter.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In sales and contracts they had neither writings to oblige them to keep their word
nor promissory notes with which to give satisfaction, but still the contract remained
valid provided only that the parties drank together publicly before witnesses. This
was particularly the usage in sales of slaves or of cacao-lands, and even today
(it is said) they use it still among themselves in the sale of horses and cattle.
The debtor never denied the debt even though he could not pay at once; but all was
made certain by the debtor&#39;s confessing his debt, for the wife, children and relatives
of the debtor would pay the debt after his death....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In the wars which because
of their ambition they made upon one another, some were taken prisoners, those of
the conquered who were taken remaining slaves. In this situation they were very
rigorous, treating the enslaved with asperity, and making use of them in all sorts
of bodily labor.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In food-supplies there were no bargains, because they were always
fixed at one price, save Maize, which was wont to go up when crops were poor, but
it never passed what it is now worth, a <i>real</i> or so, the load (which is half a Castillian fanega).</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The money that they used was little bells and jingles of copper,
which had value according to their size, and some red shells, which were brought
from far away from this land, which they strung, after the manner of rosaries. Also
they used as money grains of cacao, and of these they made the most use in commerce,
and certain precious stones and discs of copper brought from New Spain which they
exchanged for other things, as happens elsewhere....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Cogolludo (lib. iv, cap. 5)
continues with the following account of the customs:</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;For display and on gala occasions,
they used to scarify themselves with certain small points of stone on the breasts,
arms and thighs; they even went so far as to draw blood, and in the wounds they
rubbed a black earth or powdered carbon. When they scarified with these knives the
scars remained, shaped like Eagles, serpents, birds and animals, and they perforated
the nose as well.... The Cupules, who are the people of the territory of the Town
of Valladolid, used this practice a great deal.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In the times of their heathenry,
as now, they danced and sang after the manner of the Mexicans, and they used to
have, as indeed they still do have, a chief Singer (or Chanter) who intones, and
who appoints what they shall sing; and him they venerate and reverence, giving him
an honorable seat in Church, and at their assemblies and weddings. They call him
<i>Holpop</i>, and in his charge are the kettle-drums or <i>Tuncules</i> and other musical
instruments, such as the flutes, little trumpets, tortoise-shells, and others that
they used. The <i>Tuncul</i> is of thick wood, and there are some so large that they
can be heard at a distance of two leagues to leeward. To the accompaniment of these
instruments they sing their fables and old legends; all this will be reformed, or
rather, the Religious have already done so in many places, giving the Indians Histories
of Saints and some of the Mysteries of the Faith to sing, at least at public dances,
Easter celebrations, and festivities, so that the ancient times will be forgotten.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They have Babblers [Farfante = babbler, boaster; may mean jester, buffoon] who
repeat fables and ancient Histories, which I am certain would be well done away
with, or at least the costumes in which they are represented, because it appears
that they are like those of their Heathen Priests; and when there is no worse harm
than the preservation among them of that memory, it appears a very pernicious thing,
for it inclines them all the more to the idolatrous practices which they indulge
in when wearing the costume; but every one will have his own opinion in this matter,
conformable, more or less, to what his observation has taught him. The babblers
are apt to be graceful at mottoes and in the witty sayings which they tell to their
elders and Judges if they are over-rigourous, ambitious, avaricious, laying before
them the events that have taken place and even that which concerns the officer&#39;s
own duties. They thus speak to the officers&#39; very faces, and sometimes they rebuke
them with a single word. But he who would understand them must be a great linguist
and must listen well. They are very dangerous, these representations, when they
are held at night and in the Indians&#39; own houses, for God knows what goes on there,
and at the very least many of them end up in drunkenness. They call these Farfantes
<i>Balzam</i>, and they apply the word metaphorically to him who is talkative and scurrilous;
and in their representations they mimic birds.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They held, and still do hold, banquets
on the occasion of weddings and betrothals, using up in one day many turkeys that
they have been breeding for a whole year. Those who are leaving the office of Alcalde
entertain those who are entering it, on the pain of disgrace, and on election nights
there is much drunkenness.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Indians of this land were and are very dextrous
with the bow and arrows, and so they are mighty huntsmen, and they grow dogs so
that they may fetch deer, wild boar, badgers. Tigers, some little Lions, rabbits,
armadillos, iguanas, and other animals. They shoot with their arrows peacocks [sic],
some birds they call <i>faysanes</i> [pheasants], and many others.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;At present they are
great imitators of all the different sorts of handiwork that are made, and so they
learn all the trades with ease. There are many Indians in their villages, beside
those who live in the City and in the Towns, who are great workers as smiths, locksmiths, bridlemakers, shoemakers, carpenters, wood-carvers, sculptors, saddlers, tradesmen
who make many curious things out of shell, bricklayers, stonecutters, tailors, painters,
and so on. What causes wonder is that there are many Indians who work at four or
six trades where a Spaniard would have but one ... but with that almost innate coolness
for work they supply their wants and turn out good work, which they sell more cheaply
than the Spaniards do, so that those tradesmen who go to Yucathan fare badly at
their trades; so there are but few of them, and they seek other means of earning
a livelihood.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They wear clothes of very white cotton, of which they make shirts,
breeches, and certain mantles a vara and a half square which they call <i>tilmas</i>
or <i>hayantes</i>. These can be made to serve as capes by drawing the two corners up
on the shoulder and making a knot; indeed, very many people use ones made out of
somewhat coarse woven wool, and even many of stuffs brought from Spain, such as
damasks and other silks. Some use jackets, and many wear shoes and hempe sandals.
The usual custom, however, is to go barefoot, especially in their own houses and
fields, but the opposite is true of some Caciques and leading men, and of women.
Most of the men wear hats of straw or palm-leaves, and nowadays many buy felt hats.
The women use <i>Uaipiles</i>, which is a garment that falls from the throat to the middle
of the leg, with an opening at the top, where the head goes, and two others at the
top of the sides for the arms, which are covered half-way down. Because this garment
is not tied in at the waist, it also serves as a shirt. From the waist to the feet
is another garment called <i>Pic</i>, and it is like petticoats and goes under the outer
garment. Most of these are worked with blue and red thread, which makes them sightly.
If a Spanish woman is seen in this dress it looks, on her, most improper. Little
Indian girls who are growing up with Spanish women become great embroiderers, seamstresses,
and patchers, and they make things that are sold at large prices and much esteemed.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;For Sundays and Feast-days when they go to Mass, and when they are to be confessed,
both men and women have cleaner and neater clothes, which they keep for this. Other
customs and things of theirs will be learned through the laws that have been given
to remedy them, which will be related in the Fifth Book.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;There were Indians in
the past days of their ancestors who had larger bodies than those now common, bodies
which were found in the sepulchres of this land and which had gigantic stature.
In 1647 in the village of Vecal, on the royal road of Campeche, Padre Fray Juan
de Carrión (now Provincial Commissioner for the next General Chapter) ordered his
Indians to make an arbor for a reception he was to hold. They had just set up the
sticks with which it was to be made when the tools hit upon a very large sepulchre
made of flag-stones placed one over another without any peculiarities of carving
whatever. The Indians ran away from it and went to call the Padre, who, on arriving,
ordered them to take out whatever was in the sepulchre. The Indians did not want
to do this, saying that it was prohibited for them to touch anything of that sort.
So the Padre, with the aid of a small boy, got out the bones of a man of formidable
size. There were in the sepulchre three bowls of very fine pottery having three
hollow balls in place of feet, and there was a small black box of what appeared
to be jasper. The Padre burned the bones, threw them away, and filled up the hole,
rebuking the Indians for not wishing to touch it, on the plea that it was forbidden
to them to do so....&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="div1Ref_2.0" href="#div1_2.0">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
<h3>THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHICAL<br>
FEATURES OF THE ITZA STATE DURING<br>
THE PERIOD OF 1445-1697</h3>
<p class="normal"><b>The Significance of the Itzas</b>. The dates of the Itza dominance
over the region around Tayasal are roughly those given above. Although the Spaniards
became a factor in the lives of the Itzas about 1525, their presence does not alter
the fact that this tribe was so powerful as to be able to preserve its independence
for a long time. The Itzas may be considered as presenting, in diminished form,
all the more important political and social conditions that had formerly characterized
the great Maya states in the northern part of the peninsula. We will now study these
conditions so as to understand better the problems the Spanish conquerors were called
upon to meet and to solve later on. In spite of the proximity of the Spaniards,
it is doubtful whether the Itzas changed much during the two hundred and fifty years
they occupied the Peten or Tayasal region. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Location of Peten or Tayasal</b>. The Itza stronghold was located
at Peten or Tayasal.<a name="div2Ref_2.1" href="#div2_2.1"><sup>2.1</sup></a> The present city of Flores, located on a small island
in the Lake of Peten, is sometimes thought to be the site of ancient Tayasal. Others
think that Tayasal was really on the peninsula north of Flores. This latter opinion
is held by Mr. Morley and Dr. Tozzer, who have been on the spot. The former believes
that the lake was formerly higher than now, which would explain how the present
peninsula, formerly an island, attained its present condition. The island of Flores
is scarcely more than half a mile in diameter; Avendaño says that Tayasal was half
a league long. The reader is urged to compare Plates II and III for the purpose
of seeing how the modern appearance of Tayasal or Peten is different from its appearance
a few centuries ago. As visitors to Tayasal usually either came or left by way of
Tipu, the distance from Tayasal to the shore which they generally traveled was that
from the village to the eastern end of the lake, a journey often said to be six
leagues in length, which is approximately correct. Perhaps the most important piece
of evidence is that given by Avendaño&#39;s sketch map (Pls. Ia, Ib). He gives three
<i>cayos</i> or islands in the lake. They are arranged in such a way that the Cayo Grande
(Tayasal) is to the east; just northwest of it is Otro Cayo (Another Cayo). I believe
that after the general level of the lake fell these two <i>cayos</i> were united and
formed the present peninsula. Flores is on the <i>cayo</i> shown by Avendaño as just
south and east of these two. Maler, who is among those who have used the name Tayasal,
says that the name means &quot;in the midst of green waters.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Description of Peten and its Surroundings</b>. We will now give
Padre Avendaño&#39;s account of the region occupied by the Itzas and ruled by their
king, Canek: &quot;Before we leave the said Peten Ytza, it is well to give the clearest
information about it, its territories and its people, so that, in the future, historians
may have clear light about it and may give in full the necessary information. Peten
Ytza is situated in the middle of a great lake and there are not only this one on
which the King lives, but also four other <i>Petens</i>, or islands which also lie in
the said lake. Others say that these <i>Petens</i> are seven in number, and still others
that there are thirty, and that this lake also surrounds the seven, as some say,
as well as the thirty which the others speak of. What is certain is that I stopped
there and asked purposely what number of people and <i>Petens</i> the Ytzalana nation
contained, and they told me that there were only five <i>Petens</i>. The lake which surrounds
them is large, its length I have not measured, nor have I gone over more than the
part of it by which I came, which was three leagues across, more or less (entering
it at the West and going eastward), till one reaches the <i>Peten</i> on which the King
lives. But the length of the said lake which runs from North to South (as far as
we could see it), although we did not succeed in seeing to its end, was probably
from eight to ten leagues.<a name="div2Ref_2.2" href="#div2_2.2"><sup>2.2</sup></a> There are some who say that the said lake is sixty
leagues long. If it is true that it surrounds the above thirty <i>Petens</i>, it is not
improbable that it is of that length. The principal <i>Peten</i> or island (the court
where the King lives) must be more than half a league long and is a high island
from which many hills are seen all around. The situation is very pleasant on account
of these hills being in sight, as well as the five <i>Petens</i> which the lake encloses,
so that from the said <i>Petun</i> any one is seen who comes across the lake from a distance
from any one of the four directions, as well as those who go fishing on the lake....&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Lake neither Rises nor Falls</b>. &quot;I asked them why they had
their houses so close to the shore of the lake, and if they had any trouble with
its risings and fallings. They told me that they had no trouble, since the lake
never rose or fell. From this it is inferred that it is also true that no river
enters it or flows out of it on the surface,--either of rapid or gentle current,
as many who speak of this lake try to show; since, if such a stream entered it,
or left it, it could not fail to increase with the freshets, as in dry times to
grow smaller; although we should not be able to deny the hidden and subterranean
connection of this lake with other neighboring lakes, because of its permanent preservation
of level....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Temples of Tayasal Described by Avendaño</b>. &quot;In order to
worship the ... idols<a name="div2Ref_2.3" href="#div2_2.3"><sup>2.3</sup></a> there are nine very large buildings, made in the form
of the churches of this Province,--all new, with traces of others which had been
burned, although they built them again, as I saw in the case of two which had been
rebuilt. All such buildings have a wall about a yard and a half high and of the
thickness of six quarters; the bench or seat all around, which stands out from the
middle inwards, is three quarters thick and the rest, which stands out above, is
three quarters thick; so that both together form two rows of seats around the said
churches, and all repainted and polished.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Palace of Canek, Chief of the Itzas</b>. &quot;Of this same workmanship
is the hall<a name="div2Ref_2.4" href="#div2_2.4"><sup>2.4</sup></a> which the King or Ah Canek has as a vestibule to his house, in
which he receives his guests as he did us, although in addition it has the floor
covered with bitumen and polished, which the said temples do not have. At the entrance
of the said hall stands a large stone table more than two yards long and proportionally
broad, placed on stone columns, with twelve seats of the same around it for the
priests. This is the table of sacrifice, which they call in their language <i>Mayactun</i>,--the
first object which our eyes perceived in that first reception, from which, with
the preceding attempts on the lake, we were able to conjecture that they would put
us to death; and the more so when we saw that the number of people who ran together
at the novelty of seeing us was so great, that besides filling all the hall inside,
those who could not find a place there, obstructed on the outside all the light
which the hall had, and which came in all around it, so that they left us in such
gloomy darkness, that, being seated, as I was, in the midst of my companion Padres,
we could only perceive one another by the touch; but such a thing did not come into
our minds, but rather we understood that here was the room of welcome for all....&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Districts of Peten Itza</b>. &quot;I asked them how many districts
that <i>Peten</i> had on which we were, and counting by the fingers on their hands and
the toes on their feet, they told me there were twenty-two, which they went on to
describe by their names, and they are as follows:</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Districts of Peten Ytza on which
the King Ah Canek lives--</p>
<table style="width:80%; margin-left:10%">
<tr>
<td>That of King Ahcanek</td>
<td>That of Ach Cat Baca</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of noh ah chata</td>
<td>That of ach cat halach Vinic</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of Ah tze tzin batab</td>
<td>That of ach cat Mulcah</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of the cacique nohche</td>
<td>That of ach cat Kinchil</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of ach chatan ek</td>
<td>That of ach cat Kinchan</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of ach cat Cixban</td>

<td>That of ach cat Kayom (?)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of noh tzo can Punab</td>
<td>That of ach cat Cit can</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of noh tzo can noh</td>
<td>That of ach cat Ytza</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of tzo can tzic</td>
<td>That of ach cat Pop</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of ach can Matan cua</td>
<td>That of ach cat Camal</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That of ach cat Batun</td>
<td>That of ach cat Mas Kin</td></tr></table>

<p class="normal">&quot;These towns or districts
bear the names of the cacique or head who rules them, as seen by the table above,
although all have separate names of their own, and all are subject, as are also
the other <i>Petens</i>, to the King Ahcanek, and also all the communities which are
found in Cha Kan Ytza, besides those who are found on the main land towards the
East situated around the said <i>Petens</i>. This kingdom came to him by inheritance,
and so their Kings are always Ah Can Eks. But not because of this are all the Caneks
of royal blood or relations of one another; since also all those of his own town
or district are called Caneks, and not on this account are they his relations, since
they also bear their lawful names and only have this one because of the chief who
rules them. It is well known to the King that he holds this place through blood,
since it is certain that he and his family have a rare character and goodness, since
he is so very good that all treat him with some boldness, so that he is not able
to govern what he possesses....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Extent of the Itza Dominion under the Chief Canek</b>. It is from
the Franciscan Fray Alonso Cano, who wrote about 1696, that we derive the clearest
information as to the extent of the Itza dominions. He says: &quot;... The other forty-five
leagues from Mopan to the Lake one travels (though with various windings) from South
to North, with some little tendency to the North-west. This land belongs to the
Mopanes and Ahizaes, and it stretches to the East as far as the sea-coast ... Of
the boundaries of the Ahiza nation on the North the men of Yucatan will give trustworthy
information.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">All the foregoing leads one to believe that the influence of Canek,
petty chief of the Itzas, and of his immediate subjects was felt throughout the
region east of Lake Peten, the region in which are located Alain (or Yalain), San
Clemente, Yaxha, and Tipu. Indeed Villagutierre (p. 460) leaves us in no doubt as
to the fact that Chamaxculu, the aged chief of Alain, was the direct vassal of Canek.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Quincanek</b>. So far we have been considering only the political
aspect of the Itza state. There was an important sacerdotal organization as well.
As to its exact nature there is, unfortunately, some confusion. Villagutierre says
that the head of the priesthood was the oldest brother of Canek and that he bore
the title of Quincanek. Cano says that Cuin Kenek was the chief of Peten. Pedro
Sanches de Leon, writing in the eighteenth century, says (p. 146 ff.): &quot;In that
time (1700-1703), or a little before, the conquest of the Lake of the Ahitzaes took
place, and the Indian kings were seen to enter Guatemala as prisoners; they were
called after baptism Don Jose and Don Francisco Canek, and with them also was the
high-priest of this nation, who was also called Canek....&quot; Maler uses the terms
Canek and Kincanek interchangeably. The question is not an important one, and I
shall make no attempt to solve it.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Further Information about the Region</b>. &quot;... In
the northerly direction lies the Kingdom of Yucathan; towards the South, the road
which the men of Gautemala have opened, starting from Vera Paz; on the West, Cha
Kan Ytza and the Cehaches; on the East, slightly North, the nation of the men of
Tipu; in the direction of the South, running from East to West, are very high ridges,
which are really the Sierra Madre, from which (in New Spain) they exploit mines,
and as there are mines there, there is no doubt that there are some here, since
it is one and the same ridge. There must be mines in the environs of this nation
of the Ytzaes, because the most of the Indians (in some large ear drops which they
wear) have roses of silver hanging down, and others of silver and gold, and as the
Spaniards do not come to this nation, nor the Indians of this Province of Yucathan,
nor of the other provinces, because they are afraid of them, I do not know where
they could get this gold and silver unless they took it from some mine. In the said
southerly direction running towards the East, the said Peten Ytzaes have their farms
and tilled fields on the main land; and in said fields they have their houses as
in Peten, so as to live there all the time that the cultivation lasts, so that the
houses are doubled in number as well as the families. From this, people imagine
that this nation is more numerous than it really is.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The largest and best calculation
which I can make of this nation was from the account which the King and his chiefs
gave me, and this was that the <i>Peten</i> in which we stopped consisted of twenty-two
districts and towns, and they did not know how to give me the count of each town,
since they know how to count only up to twenty, and in going beyond many twenties,
they do not know how to explain it, for it appears to them an infinite number.<a name="div2Ref_2.5" href="#div2_2.5"><sup>2.5</sup></a>
I did not have much time to verify this, for I preferred to employ the little time
I had in baptizing; but nevertheless from what I saw and understood of the number
of the people of all ages, I say that Peten Ytza, with the other <i>Petenes</i>, Cha
Kan Ytzaes and Tuluncies (?), with the communities, which are found on the main
land, will all come up to twenty-four or twenty-five thousand souls,--a thousand
more or less. This computation I make from the <i>Peten</i> on which the King lives,
for he told me that all the <i>Petens</i> were equal in the number of people, with but
little difference.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Itzas Described</b>. &quot;These Ytzaes are well-featured and, like
mestizos, nearly all of a light complexion and of very perfect stature and of natural
gifts. But the Devil has compelled them, in their weakness, to make themselves hideous
and witches, because it appears to them a greater feat to frighten by their appearance
than to conquer by their strength. And so most of them have their faces cut and
rubbed in with black, and some streaked like black negroes. And this hideousness
many women also show in their ear lobes, so that it is not possible for them to
wear ear drops or pendants. Painting themselves or cutting on their faces the form
of the animal which they have as a charm, the men consider themselves as more genteel
than the women; and as they are of this opinion, they dress themselves in this way,
tying up their hair with bands of cotton which are made by them, woven with many
curious designs of various colors, with cords and tassels at the ends, made very
beautifully. They clothe themselves with something like jackets with half sleeves,
and all from top to bottom woven at intervals with stripes of various designs and
incorporated in the same woof,--very lovely to look at. And with all these elegantly
ornamented clothes, they always paint themselves red and black. All this vanity
and effeminate care to decorate themselves so much is a sign of what many believe,
that it is [due to] the wicked vice which is common among them; for the women do
not go about well clothed nor do the men pay much attention to them; for the women
wear only some skirts of cotton from their waist down, but from the waist up they
go bare and uncovered, with their hair rolled up without as much care as the men.
The latter always go with little stools under their arms to sit on wherever they
go; and at night they muffle themselves up with sheets woven of various stripes
and designs of different colors, like cloaks; their drink is always <i>posole</i> or
<i>saca</i>, which is a drink made of cooked maize, and they always drink it lukewarm,
but they never like to drink clear or cold water....&quot;</p>

<h3>THE FIRST SPANISH ENTRADAS INTO YUCATAN</h3>
<p class="normal"><b>The First Spaniards in Yucatan</b>. Although Fernando Cortes was the
first Spaniard to penetrate the region occupied by the Itzas, he was not, of course,
the first of his race to become acquainted with Yucatan and its inhabitants. It
will be remembered that Columbus received a hint of the existence of Yucatan from
some Indian traders at the Isla de Guanajo (Isla de Piños) in the year 1502. (Cogolludo,
lib. i, cap 1.)<a name="div2Ref_3.1" href="#div2_3.1"><sup>3.1</sup></a> Although he failed to find it, we may say that from July, 1502,
Yucatan was known to the Spaniards. The first Spaniards who actually coasted the
shore of Yucatan were Juan Diaz de Solis and Vicente Yañez Pinzon, in the year 1506.</p>
<p class="normal">In 1511 or 1512 Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, whose expedition was in Darien, found it
necessary to send to Hispaniola for supplies. He chose a certain Valdivia for the
errand, intrusted him with a caravel, and sent him off. Valdivia was shipwrecked
on Las Viboras, a reef near Jamaica, and only about twenty of his men escaped. (Molina,
p. 11 ff.; Montesinos, vol. ii, p. 28 ff.; Landa, p. 15.) They were all captured
by some Indians from Yucatan, who sacrificed all except Jerónimo de Aguilar and
Gonzalo Guerrero. The latter of these learned the language and went to Chectemal,
where he married an Indian woman and became a member of the tribe. (Landa, pp. 14-16.
Chectemal = Salamanca = Bacalar = Bakhalal.)</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba, 1517</b>.
All the Spaniards mentioned thus far are connected only very remotely with our subject.
In 1517, however, under the auspices of Diego Velazquez, Governor of Cuba, an expedition
was fitted out under the command of Don Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba. (Bernal
Diaz, vol. i, p. 11; Landa, p. 16 ff.) As this and one other expedition immediately
preceded the entrada of Cortes, and as they both came in contact with members of
the Maya race, it is well that a short account of the expeditions of Cordoba and
of Grijalva should be given.</p>
<p class="normal">Cordoba, with three ships provided by himself. Lope
Ochoa de Caicedo, and Cristoval Morante, left Cuba on February 8, 1517. The avowed
purpose of the expedition was to capture slaves for the Cuban market, and although
it was directly against the royal will, Velazquez himself was interested in the
project. After a sail of twenty-one days the three ships sighted a large town some
two leagues from shore. This spot was named Cape Catoche by the Spaniards. A brisk
fight took place there between the natives and the white men, in which the latter
were the victors. Many Indian towns and settlements were seen as the Spaniards went
along the shore toward the west. Everywhere the Indians crowded out of their houses,
temples, and idol houses to see the newcomers. At length the town of Champoton was
reached. There, it will be remembered, the Itzas had lived for many years. However
demoralized the Maya race may have become elsewhere, here at least it was vigorous
enough, for the Indians of Champoton or Potonchan inflicted a great defeat on the
Spaniards. (Bernal Diaz, vol. i, p. 24; Landa, p. 20.) The party went back to Cuba
very shortly, and Cordoba reported to Velazquez as to what had been found. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Juan de Grijalva and Others, 1518</b>. In the spring of 1518 Velazquez
caused another expedition to be fitted out. Juan de Grijalva was to be the commodore,
and Alonso de Avila, Francisco de Montejo, and Pedro de Albarado were each to have
command of a ship. From our point of view the most important thing this expedition
did was to visit the island of Cozumel. They also visited las Mugers which takes
its name from the female idols found there by the Spaniards. This party also touched
at Champoton and even went as far as San Juan de Ulloa and the Rio Panuco.<a name="div2Ref_3.2" href="#div2_3.2"><sup>3.2</sup></a>
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes in Mexico, 1519</b>. The next year, 1519, witnessed the
setting out of Fernando or Hernando or Hernan Cortes. His achievements in Mexico
in the years 1519-1524 in nowise concern us. In the latter year, however, he inaugurated
the bold project of reaching Honduras by land from Mexico. As an inevitable result
of this plan he entered the territory of the Itzas. Villagutierre&#39;s account (lib.
i, caps. 7, 8) of this expedition is so complete that it is best for us to quote
it in full. The reader is urged to study Plate VI in order to learn the routes followed
by Cortes and others. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Villagutierre&#39;s Account of the Entrada of Cortes, 1524-1525</b>.
&quot;The Itzalana nation, having reached its place of retirement, was now fortified
in those Islands and Lakes which they occupied in the midst of many other barbarous
forest nations, for none of the rest was as powerful as they.... After much fighting,
Don Fernando Cortes had, by force of arms and with many brilliant deeds, captured
the Great City of Mexico, Capital of the Northern American Empire. Also he had subjugated
many other regions, nearly all of New Spain, by 1521.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In 1524, being desirous of
settling Hibueras or Honduras, which is a very good land, albeit far from Mexico,
he [Cortes] had armed five ships and a brigantine, all well provided with every
sort of equipment. In these he sent off four hundred Spaniards and thirty horses<a name="div2Ref_3.3" href="#div2_3.3"><sup>3.3</sup></a>
under the charge of Christoval de Olid, who had orders to take on at Havana as many
more troops as were ready to go. Afterwards they were all to go and settle on the
coast of Honduras, which was the purpose of the voyage. But Christoval de Olid rose
in rebellion with the ships and soldiers. At length he arrived in Honduras, having
taken prisoner Gil Gonzalez de Avila. When all this was learned by Don Fernando
Cortes he sent Francisco de las Casas with two ships and some soldiers against the
rebel. Him also did Christoval de Olid take prisoner. Afterwards occurred the great
revolts, quarrels and murders which the historians relate, but which I will not
repeat.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes Starts for Honduras</b>. &quot;Don Fernando Cortes was greatly
enraged that Christoval de Olid, his old friend, should thus have risen up against
him, causing so much ruin. So he determined to go in person to punish Olid. Nor
did the thought of the great loss his absence would be to Mexico suffice to dissuade
him....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;No arguments in the least changed his decision. He assembled all the Spaniards
he could; there were more than four hundred infantry and cavalry, besides much artillery
and baggage. In addition, there were between three and four thousand Indian warriors
from Mexico, among whom were King Quatemoz, the successor of the great Motezuma,...
and the Lords of Tacuba and Tezcuco, cities on the Lake of Mexico, and other Mexican
Lords. With these, Cortes took his march by land, and through regions so rough and
impenetrable that they had never been pressed by human feet. They forced their way
through the forests, opening paths and building very large bridges of wood so disproportionately
thick that some of them are still standing today and are called &#39;Bridges of Cortes.&#39;
Cortes and his followers suffered hunger, bruises, illnesses, hard roads, worse
lodgings, and other insupportable trials, so that to tell them all entire books
would be needed.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes Arrives at Izancanac</b>. &quot;Don Fernando Cortes and those
who were with him arrived at the city of Izancanac<a name="div2Ref_3.4" href="#div2_3.4"><sup>3.4</sup></a> in the Province of Acalan.
There was discovered the plot which King Quatemoz, the Lord of Tacuba, and other
Mexican chiefs had made between themselves to attack the Spaniards while they were
crossing some river or marsh. When all the Spaniards were killed, the Mexicans planned
to recover their dominions, breaking forth from their captivity. Having held a trial
(although some say he did not do so) Cortes gave orders that Quatemoz should be
hanged, together with the Lord of Tacuba, his cousin, and other principal Mexicans.
Eight, it is said, were hung....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Description of a Large Town</b>. &quot;When these events had been completed,
and while the army was marching forward over bad roads, they came upon a pueblo
very large and new, in which the houses had been but recently completed. The place
was surrounded with very thick stockades of logs and of very sturdy planks. Before
the entrance were deep trenches. This wall encircled the town in two rings, both
very high. One was like a barbican, having towers and loopholes for the archers.
In another place, but near the town, on some lofty rocks, were their watch-towers
of stone, worked by hand and provided with adequate railings. On another side was
a deep marsh, and all these things served to make the pueblo a great fortress.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The
Spaniards entered the town without hindrance and found it deserted and lonely. The
Indians, its inhabitants, receiving news that the Spaniards were coming, had withdrawn
to some large marshes some distance from the pueblo. On inspecting the town and
entering the houses our men found in all and each one of them a great quantity of
turkeys all prepared and dressed for eating by those Indians. Besides these things
they also found much corn-bread and other supplies such as drinks, and a dish made
of meat mixed with corn-bread called by those Indians <i>tamales</i>. They were all amazed
at seeing such a novelty, and they were, at the same time, delighted to see so much
good food, as they had suffered so much from hunger and lack of nourishment.&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Spaniards Suspect Treachery</b>. &quot;All this set them to thinking,
because it was such a new state of affairs, and they were puzzled to know the plans
of the Indians of that town, as much because of the novelty of the situation as
because they found in the middle of the village a house full of lances, bows, arrows,
<i>macanas</i>, and other arms used by those Indians in their wars. And going out to
see if any troops were to be found outside of the village, they found no one, nor
was there, in the <i>milpas</i> or farms, a single grain of maize or any other vegetable;
so that the Spaniards were all the more confounded, and they marveled, asking one
another what it could mean.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;While the Spaniards were in this suspense, fifteen
Indians came from outside the town who, as it was learned afterward, were very important
men; and when they arrived they went into the presence of Don Fernando Cortes. Placing
their hands upon the ground, and kissing the earth with great humility, and half
weeping, they begged Cortes to favor them by not burning their village, for they
had come there but recently to fortify themselves against some other Indians called Lacandones,<a name="div2Ref_3.5" href="#div2_3.5"><sup>3.5</sup></a> who were their enemies. These had been making a cruel war upon
them, killing many men and leveling and burning their villages, which they had formerly
had on the plains, as the Spaniards would see for themselves....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Don Fernando
Cortes assured them by means of the Indian, Doña Marina (whom he had had with him
ever since he entered Tabasco), that no harm should be done them, nor would he permit
any of his men to misuse anything which was theirs. Thereupon the Indians recovered
their upright position, and then Don Fernando Cortes asked, with great curiosity,
why so many turkeys and fowls and all sorts of food had been prepared for his coming.&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Indians Explain why their Town was Deserted</b>. &quot;The Indians
replied promptly that it was because they had been expecting their mortal enemies,
the Lacandones, who were coming to attack them. If the Lacandones won in battle,
they knew that all their property and fowls would be taken away. If the outcome
was of that sort, they did not want their enemies to enjoy and avail themselves
of their goods, so they had intended to eat them themselves. For if they should
conquer the Lacandones in battle, they would go to their villages and take away
all that they had, so that they would feel no lack of what they had already eaten
in their own houses.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes Takes Leave of them in a Friendly Spirit</b>. &quot;Don Fernando
Cortes said to them that he was much grieved by their wars and quarrels, and that,
because he was forced to continue his journey, he could not stop, nor could he aid
them and defend them against those enemies of theirs. But, he added, had the situation
been otherwise, he would have done so, and they would see, what they could not well
imagine, how he would leave the Lacandones well punished and these Indians in peace
and security in their houses.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;With these affectionate speeches, and seeing that
no harm was done to them, those Indians were greatly contented. They gave thanks,
after their fashion, to Cortes and his men, and at the same time, they gave him
guides so that he might proceed with his army, which he did. Other large pueblos
were encountered which, like this one from which they started out, they called the Mazotecas. This is the same as Villages of Deer, and the name was given because
of the large numbers there are in that level country whence they set out.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Deer Hunt</b>. &quot;The deer ran away so little and were so free
from fright at the men that our soldiers on horseback were able to come up with
them and kill them as they wished. In this way the men killed many of them and ate
them for some days after. The Indian guides, who were showing the Spaniards everything
and all those villages of their people which had been burned and razed, on being
asked why it was that having so many deer at hand, they permitted them to be so
tame. The Indians replied that in their villages they held the deer to be gods,
for their greatest idol had appeared to them in that form and commanded them not
to kill the deer, nor frighten them. They had executed this command, and as a result
the deer were not easily scared, nor did they flee from the soldiers, and they were
very numerous....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Cortes and his men set forth from these villages of the Mazotecas
and from the province of Acalan (which in after years, during the conquest of the
Kingdom of Yucatan, was subjected by Captain Francisco de Tamayo Pacheco, who had
come out in quest of it from the City of Merida)....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Army of Cortes Proceeds on its Way</b>. &quot;Once more the army
of Cortes went forward through rough and broken country. As always, he sent camp-scouts
ahead on horseback and single soldiers afoot; these encountered two Indians from
another village further on, who were out hunting and were carrying a large lion
[puma, jaguar?] as well as a great quantity of iguanas, which are a kind of small
serpent and very good to eat. These Indians led them [the army] to their village,
and from there the army took its road towards the mountains, asking all whom they
met whether they had seen bearded men like them, for they were seeking them. Some
of the Indians who were questioned replied, saying: That those of whom they spoke
were ahead, and were journeying in the same direction....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Lake</b>. &quot;When the army left the place where it had spent
the night, and while it was mounting the slope of the mountains, but a short time
had elapsed when those in the vanguard began to catch glimpses of great Laguna,
in the middle of which was an island with a large town, which, as was afterwards
learned, was the chief place of that whole Province of Itza. [These were the people
who had withdrawn one hundred years before from Yucatan, as has been said.] And
it was possible to enter this town only by means of boats.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>They Capture an Indian</b>. &quot;The camp-scouts had by now reached
the shore of the Lake itself, and they brought to Cortes an Indian whom one Pedro
de Ayuda, one of the explorers, had taken from a canoe. Then Cortes asked this captured
Indian (as he did to all the rest) whether or not the Spaniards or Bearded Men,
like him and his men, had been through that region or were still in it, as he had
been given to understand was the case.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Indian replied that in that town nothing
was known of such men as they. He added, that if they wished to go to the town,
there were some cultivated fields near the largest arm of the Lake where they could
take many boats from the laborers who were tilling their fields, and he offered
to lead them thither if it pleased them that he should do so.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Don Fernando Cortes,
with twelve crossbowmen, followed this Indian on foot by a very bad path which,
after passing for a long distance through swamps with mud up to the knee, at length
led to the water. And because the party had delayed a long time in reaching the
farms, on account of the badness of the path, it was discovered by the laborers,
who, judging that harm was intended, fled into their canoes and made for the island
in the Lake, rowing as hard as possible.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The army encamped in the farms on the
shore of the Lake and fortified itself very well, because that Indian guide had
told Cortes that the Itzas were a people well skilled in war and that they were
feared by the whole region. And also this Indian told the Spaniards that if they
would let him go he would cross to the city in his canoe and would speak to Canek,
Lord of those Lands of the Itzas, and would tell him of their intention, and of
their arrival.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Indian is Sent to Tayasal</b>. &quot;Cortes acceded to this request,
and gave orders that he should be set free. At midnight the Indian returned to the
army. As it was two leagues from mainland to the Island or <i>Peten</i> (as they called
it), he could not return earlier. He brought with him two chiefs of that City who
came to visit Cortes by order of Canek, who had told them to see on his behalf the
Captain General of that army and learn from his lips what it was he wished.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Some Indians Come to Cortes from Tayasal</b>. &quot;Don Fernando Cortes
gave these personages some Spanish soldiers as hostages, so that the Canek or Lord
might be able to come to the Royal camp. And after Cortes had treated them with
so much courtesy, kindness, and graciousness that those Indians were delighted with
him, as well as with the Spaniards&#39; beards, clothes, arms, and horses, he took leave
of them and they went away. And on the following day Canek came to the camp with
thirty-two chiefs and many <i>Zamaguales</i> or common people, who came in their canoes,
bringing with them the Spanish hostages and without showing any signs of fear or
of hostility.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Canek himself Comes and is Courteously Received</b>. &quot;Don Fernando
Cortes received Canek with much love and urbanity. After saluting one another, and
speaking by means of interpreters, Cortes, to honor him and to show Canek how the
Christians adored their God, had a mass sung with all solemnity to the sound of
the reed instruments, sackbuts, or flageolets which he had with him, and he had
out his best table ornaments, so as to treat Canek with great majesty.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Canek Hears Mass and Promises to Put away his Idols</b>. &quot;Canek
listened to the mass with great attention and took good notice of the Ceremonies,
decorations, and the altar-service, and he derived much pleasure from what was shown
him. He praised highly the music, saying that such a thing had never been heard
before, and those who were with him were astonished and fascinated at seeing and
hearing it.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And when the religious and clerics had finished the divine office,
they preached to Canek, urging him to put away his idols and see how good was the
Law of God.... They told Canek that his idols were but pieces of stone or old wood
harboring demons and that he was deceived in them and that all who believed in them
would lose their souls and would be carried to the Infernal regions.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Canek replied
that he would willingly leave his Idols and that he wished to know the manner in
which they venerated the True God of whom they told him and whom they declared unto
him, and he asked for a cross in order to place it in his village. Don Fernando
Cortes told him that soon it would be given to him, as it had been done in the other
pueblos through which they had passed. The Padres said the same and added that as
soon as possible men should be sent to him to instruct him and all his vassals in
the Faith of Christ our Lord, for at present it could not be done, as many important
things were pressing....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Don Fernando Cortes made to Canek a very full and eloquent
speech about the Emperor Charles V and his many dominions and his great sovereign
power; Cortes begged Canek and urged him with affectionate arguments to be the vassal
of the Emperor, as were already the Lords of the great Kingdom of Mexico and many
others. Canek replied, saying that he thus gave himself up; for, many years before,
men of Tabasco, when passing through his lands into the wilderness, had told him
that certain Strangers had arrived at their villages and that they fought much and
well, for they had conquered the Tabascans in three battles.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And Cortes told Canek
that he himself was the Captain of those of whom the Tabascans spoke, and that he
had conquered them and subjected them to his will. Thereupon the conversation came
to a close and they all sat down to eat with much ostentatious magnificence. And
it was suitable that it should be so, in order that those Indians might come to
esteem and fear the Spaniards, and thus know how majestic was their King.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Canek
ordered his vassals to bring from the canoes birds, fishes, cakes, honey, and gold
(though only a little of the latter), and beads of red snail-shells, which the Indians
value highly. They ate, and Cortes gave Canek a shirt, and a cap of black velvet,
and some little things of iron, such as scissors and knives.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Once again Don Fernando
Cortes asked Canek about some Spaniards of his who should be on the coast of the
sea, not far from there. To this Canek replied that he indeed had news of them and
that he would give Cortes a man who should lead him to where they were without wandering
from the road, although it was rough and bad on account of the great forests, rivers,
and marshes that had to be traversed; once the sea was reached the going would not
be so difficult.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes Goes to Tayasal with Canek</b>. &quot;Don Fernando Cortes thanked
him very much, but told him that the horses could not go in the canoes in order
to cross the Lake and continue their journey. Canek replied that after a matter
of three leagues the Lake would be left behind, and he begged that while the army
was marching around by land Don Fernando Cortes should come with him to his city
to see him burn the idols. Don Fernando Cortes did so, against the advice of all
his captains, who held that he was of great foolhardiness and overconfidence.&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Itzas Give Cortes News of Olid</b>. &quot;Cortes embarked with thirty
crossbowmen, Canek, and the chief Indians for the town on the Island, which town
was very large, and from a long way off they saw the whiteness of its many houses
and adoratoria. And on reaching the town Canek received Cortes with great rejoicing,
regaling him, as well as he could, with a present of poor gold of little value (for
it is not found in that country) and some mantles. And there the Indians informed
Cortes of where the two villages of the Bearded Men (as they call the Spaniards)
were. They said that one of them was called Pueblo de Nito (Ferns) and was on the
coast to the north, while the other was called Pueblo de Naco and was inland.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;This
news brought great joy to Cortes and his men on account of the great desire they
all had to find the Spaniards in search of whom they had undertaken this perilous
journey.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Those of the army who were marching along the shore of the Lake went with
great care, being suspicious lest the affability of Canek was but a piece of premeditated
craftiness to enable him to perpetrate some treachery.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes Takes Leave of Canek, Leaving Morzillo</b>. &quot;But things
did not take such a course as they had feared. Indeed, Don Fernando Cortes was ahead
of time (at the meeting place) with all his crossbowmen, and when he joined with
the main body of his army he rid the rest of all the anxiety they had suffered during
his absence.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;He took leave of Canek and the Itza Indians who had accompanied him
to the mainland. He left in their charge his horse Morzillo, which had been injured
in the ankle, charging them to take good care of him, and to cure him. Cortes said
that he would send after the horse from the place where he should meet those Spaniards
for whom he was seeking. Such horses were, he said, esteemed highly, for it was
a good horse.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Idols not Burnt</b>. &quot;There was no burning of the idols, nor anything
else of the sort, in that city of Tayasal (as they call it) or Chief City of Canek.
Some say, however, that the idols were burnt in the presence of Cortes, but in truth,
from the time when he left his horse among the Itza Infidels, they had a worse and
more abominable idol than they had had before, as we shall see later....&quot;<a name="div2Ref_3.6" href="#div2_3.6"><sup>3.6</sup></a>
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cortes Arrives in Honduras</b>. &quot;With ... innumerable other excessive
trials, at the end of many days, they arrived at Honduras and met the Spaniards
in search of whom they had come, in the villages of Naco and Nito, which Gil Gonzalez
de Avila and Christoval de Olid had settled with Spaniards. The town of Nito was
founded by Avila and was called San Gil de Buena Vista. All that happened is to
be found and read in the Histories of the Indies and it does not concern this History.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Only this concerns us: on account of a variety of circumstances Don Fernando Cortes
neither returned himself through the land of the Itzas, nor did he send after his
horse, nor did he send the Missionary Fathers to the Itzas, as he had offered to
do.... So that that wretched little ruler, Lord of the Itzas or Canek, and all his
subjects, remained as barbarous and idolatrous as they were before, and even daily
grew more so, as well as becoming more horrible, cruel, atrocious, and formidable.
And in this state we must leave them until the time comes for us once more to speak
of them....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Though this account of the entrada made by Cortes into the country
of the Itzas seems full enough, it differs, nevertheless, from some of the others.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Comparison of Villagutierre with Other Authorities</b>. In the
first place Villagutierre tells us that the motive which led Cortes into sending
an expedition to Honduras was that &quot;it was a very good land,&quot; and when, because
of Olid&#39;s treachery, it became necessary for him to go thither himself, Villagutierre
says he took four hundred Spaniards and thirty horses. Bernal Diaz (vol. iv, p.
283 ff.) differs widely from this account in several respects. He says that Cortes
hoped to find a passage to the Spice Islands, and that it was for that purpose that
he sent out Olid, on whom he believed he could rely. Olid, though brave enough,
was not a wise or faithful man. He fell a victim to the machinations of Diego Velazquez,
Governor of Cuba, who was a mortal enemy of Cortes.</p>
<p class="normal">According to Cogolludo (lib.
i, cap. 13) it was very much against the advice of his associates in Mexico that
Cortes went in person to Honduras. He tells us that the vanguard of the Spaniards,
after capturing ten Indian men and two Indian women, who were treated kindly, sent
one of their canoes to the island of Tayasal with six Indians and two Spaniards,
who were to give Canek some small Castilian presents. As a result of this, when
the main body of the army, under Cortes himself, reached the shore of the lake,
Canek and several of his chiefs were waiting for them. The rest of the account of
Cogolludo is the same as that of Villagutierre.</p>
<p class="normal">In his Fifth Letter, Cortes furnishes
some interesting details with which we will complete our account of the first entrada
into the Itza territory. He tells us (The Letters of Cortes to Charles V, MacNutt&#39;s
translation, vol. ii, p. 259) that Apospolon. Lord of Izancanac, first pretended
to be dead, being in fear of Cortes, but that later he took the Spaniards to Izancanac,
which was &quot;quite large, and has many mosques.&quot; This Apospolon was a sort of merchant
prince and had widespread trading connections. At Nito, where Cortes met Gil Gonzalez
de Avila, a whole quarter &quot;was peopled with his agents under command of one of his
brothers.&quot; The articles of trade were, of course, only such things as cocoa, mantles,
red shells, and dyes. As the people of Izancanac were near neighbors of the Itzas,
and as the latter lay between them and Nito, it seems as if it must have been almost
inevitable that the two tribes, the subjects of Apospolon and those of Canek, should
have had much in common.</p>
<p class="normal">When Cortes left Izancanac he passed through the fortified
village, the name of which no one mentions, and later came to that of Tiac, which
was still larger and very well built. From the province of Mazatlan (in which was
Tiac) to that of Taiza (Itza) was a matter of four nights. At length he reached
the lake, which he thought to be an arm of the sea, and from the shore he saw Tayasal.
He found that his scouts had captured an Indian, who gave valuable information.
From this point the account of Cortes agrees absolutely with that of Villagutierre,
even to the number of the crossbowmen (twelve) whom Cortes took with him.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that
we have compared all the important accounts of this entrada we must summarize our
impressions. In the first place it is clear enough that a possibility may exist
of Villagutierre having copied Cogolludo minutely. In the second place it is equally
clear that in those instances where Villagutierre puts aside Cogolludo he draws
from someone else of even more authority. Therefore we may safely believe that in
quoting the accounts of various events given by Villagutierre we shall be availing
ourselves of the best possible information. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Canek&#39;s Attitude toward Cortes</b>. At the time when Cortes was
at Tayasal (1525) a tolerant attitude toward the white men was prevalent. Far from
resenting the proposed change in religion, the Canek of that day seems rather to
have welcomed the new faith, and one can readily believe that had Cortes been able
to do all that he promised, an early Christianization of the Itzas would have taken
place. Instead, however, as we shall see, their idolatrous ways were to continue
for many decades, and their attitude was to suffer a great change which, we must
concede, is largely to be accounted for by Spanish brutality and bad faith.</p>
<p class="normal">The
foregoing is all in harmony with what Gomara says. He especially emphasizes the
friendly attitude of Canek. (Gomara, 1826, vol. ii, p. 136 ff.)<a name="div2Ref_3.7" href="#div2_3.7"><sup>3.7</sup></a></p>

<h3>THE ENTRADA OF FRANCISCO DE MONTEJO AND<br>
HIS SON, AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE<br>
FRANCISCANS, 1526-1542</h3>
<p class="normal"><b>Francisco de Montejo and his Son</b>. Although northern Yucatan was
reduced to the condition of an orderly Spanish possession some one hundred and fifty
years before the Peten region, it was done, nevertheless, only at the cost of many
years of desperate struggling. Two men, Don Francisco de Montejo the Elder and Don
Francisco de Montejo the Younger, his son, were the leading figures in the undertaking.
The elder Montejo seems to have been a man of gentle birth and of fairly good property.
He came to America about 1514 under Pedrarias Dávila. Soon after that, however,
he left Dávila and settled in Cuba, where he served under Velazquez. He also served,
a few years later, under Cortes in Mexico.</p>
<p class="normal">Soon after the granting of a patent or
general order Francisco de Montejo the Elder set forth on his undertaking. Several
officials were appointed to accompany him. Alonso Dávila was Contador (Paymaster),
Pedro de Lima was Tesorero (Treasurer), and Hernando Moreno de Quito was Veedor
de las Fundiciones (Overseer of the Smelters). (Cogolludo, p. 73.)<a name="div2Ref_4.1" href="#div2_4.1"><sup>4.1</sup></a> Of these
three offices the last was a sinecure by reason of the absence of mines in Yucatan.
Dávila had taken an active part in the conquest of Mexico. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Montejo&#39;s Preparations and Sacrifices</b>. The expedition numbered
some four hundred soldiers, in addition to the crews who manned the four ships.
The expense, all borne by Montejo, was heavy. To furnish the necessary arms, horses,
and munitions the Adelantado found himself obliged to sell a Mayorazgo (entailed
estate) yielding one thousand ducats a year ($2500, equal to about $10,000 of modern
money). The seamen received pay, but the rest of the expedition received no money,
depending on their fortune in the New World for remuneration. Only one cleric, Francisco
Hernandez, accompanied the expedition; he was its chaplain. He later attributed
the failure of the expedition to the lack of priests. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>He Sets out</b>. Setting out in 1527, the expedition arrived at
Cozumel, where a landing was effected. There, as elsewhere, the Spaniards found
themselves at a great disadvantage in having no interpreter. By various makeshifts,
however, they made themselves understood, and poor Montejo, misled by the seeming
docility of the natives, flattered himself that he had an easy task before him.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Montejo and his Men Go along the Shore of Yucatan</b>. Skirting
the eastern shore of Yucatan, the fleet arrived at a point near the first site of
Valladolid, where all the soldiers landed, leaving the seamen to guard the ships
and supplies. What seemed a sufficient number of horses, munitions, and provisions
was taken. As usual on such occasions, the first thing to be done was to take formal
possession of the land for the King of Castile. Accordingly appropriate ceremonies
were carried through, and the standard bearer, Gonzalo Nieto, unfurled the royal
banner. Cogolludo is very definite as to the region in which the conquest of Yucatan
had its beginning. Valladolid,<a name="div2Ref_4.2" href="#div2_4.2"><sup>4.2</sup></a> not Bakhalal or Campeche, is, he says, the site
of the first operations. He quotes as his authority on this point the Bachiller
Valencia, a native of Valladolid, whose Relación was made in 1639. Coni, a village
in the province of Choaca,<a name="div2Ref_4.3" href="#div2_4.3"><sup>4.3</sup></a> was reached. Some of the chiefs of the region came
to see the Adelantado and were well received; they, however, were treacherously
minded, but their attempt to kill or injure Montejo was foiled. From Coni the Spaniards
went to the village of Choaca, where their real trials began. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Description of the Campaign</b>. In their early wanderings the
Spaniards suffered greatly from lack of proper water and from bad roads. Often they
found the villages deserted by their inhabitants or, still worse, bristling with
armed warriors. Led by an Indian whom they had picked up at Coni, Montejo and his
followers traveled through the province of Choaca to a place called Aké. On the
way they ran into an ambush of armed Indians. The weapons of these latter consisted
of arrows hardened by fire, lances with sharp flint points, two-handed swords of
very hard wood, and shields made of very large tortoise shells adorned with snail
shells and antlers; their bodies were naked save for breech clouts of flimsy material,
and they were all painted. Since the Indians were as stubborn as they were brave,
and as the Spaniards found themselves at a disadvantage, being unable to use their
horses properly on account of the rough country, the fight was a fierce one; the
Adelantado himself acted well, showing the less experienced of his followers the
best way to combat the Indians. The Spaniards, greatly outnumbered, kept up the
fight all day, receiving many lance wounds in their faces and bodies; many died;
more were seriously wounded. The horses and bloodhounds also suffered greatly. Only
after a second day of fighting did the Indians finally flee, leaving twelve hundred
of their companions dead behind them. This first victory over the Indians took place
in the last weeks of 1527. Cogolludo dwells at great length on the errors of Herrera
(Dec. ix, lib. iii, cap. 3) concerning the founding of Tihoo or Merida and of Chichen
Itza. According to Herrera, Montejo went to Tihoo, where he came into contact with
the Cheles, who showed him Chichen Itza, seven leagues away. The Tutul Xiu, Lords
of Mani, were then ruling there, and with them, Herrera says, the Spaniards made
a peaceful arrangement. All this, according to Cogolludo, is wrong. In the opinion
of Cogolludo, events were as follows. After the battle of Aké, Montejo determined
to proceed cautiously and to endeavor by peaceful means to win over the natives
to obedience to the king. Slowly he made his way to Chichen Itza, which, by reason
of its great buildings, seemed to him a suitable place for one of the two fortresses
he was to build. Having fortified himself against attacks, he set about subduing
the country. He managed to win the friendship of the Indians of that neighborhood.
A village of Spaniards with houses built after the native plan was erected. The
dwellings were made of vertical wooden logs and had palm-leaf roofs. One hundred
and seventy Spaniards were left in the new settlement. One of the first things done
was to divide the land among them. Cogolludo thinks that the name first given to
the new village was that of Salamanca. Misled by the seeming peacefulness of the
Indians, Montejo determined to divide them up into <i>encomiendas</i>. The plan was carried
out, to the secret disgust of the Indians, who determined to get free as soon as
an opportunity offered. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Dávila and Vazquez Search vainly for Gold in the Region of
Chetemal</b>. From the map which Montejo had with him it was learned that there were
gold mines in the vicinity of Bakhalal, which place the Indians called Vaymil or
Chetemal. Because no sign of gold had been seen in that part of the country through
which they had hitherto been, the soldiers were getting downhearted, and Montejo
determined to send a party in search of mines. Captain Alonso Dávila, the Royal
Paymaster, with fifty Spaniards and sixteen horses, was sent to found a village
at a place called Tulma (Tuloom?) in the province of Cochva. A mine expert, one
Francisco Vazquez, accompanied the party in the hopes of earning the reward of three
hundred ducats which Montejo offered to the discoverer of gold mines. When Tulma
was reached it was found to be entirely unsuitable for a village, and the explorers
went on to the now deserted town of Chablé, which was a place reported to have gold
mines. The cacique of Chablé received them well; but the cacique of Chetemal was
bellicose and would give no aid when Montejo sent to find out whether there were
gold mines at Bakhalal, a town in his domain. With twenty men and eight horses the
Adelantado set forth to punish this chief. At the end of a hard journey he found
Chetemal deserted. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Foundation of Villa Real de Chetemal</b>. Chetemal, however, seemed
to have been admirably adapted for the site of a town, and so, when the rest of
his men, together with some Indians, had arrived from Chablé, the town of Villa
Real de Chetemal was established by Dávila. The cacique of Chetemal was treacherous
in his intentions; several skirmishes took place between his men and the Spaniards,
in which the latter, through superior arms, were the victors. An attempt made by
Dávila to get to Montejo a report of all that had been done in the last two months
was foiled by some Indians, who killed Dávila&#39;s messengers. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Hardships of those who Were at Chichen</b>. Meanwhile those Spaniards
who had remained behind with the Adelantado in Chichen Itza were also in grave straits,
not only because of the hostility and ill-will of the Indians, but also because
of the lack of various things they had brought from Spain but had been left behind
in their ships which were not now to be reached. Their condition daily grew worse.</p>
<p class="normal">Dávila and his men wandered back and forth between Villa Real and Chablé (where
the Indians were more or less friendly) in search of gold and in the hope of establishing
their power. At length even the Indians of Chablé grew weary of them, and the Spaniards
under Dávila set off on their journeys once more. Finally they came to Bakhalal,
where some seemingly friendly Indian chiefs offered to carry letters to Montejo.
They, however, like all the rest, were traitorous, and the Indians of the province
of Cochva were so turbulent that Dávila determined to make war on them. To do this
he had the help of the chief men of Vaymil, and he hoped for that of those of Chablé.
When he returned to the latter place, he found that it had rebelled against his
authority. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Continual Misfortunes</b>. In the events which follow one note,
misfortune, makes itself heard above the confusion. Battles, skirmishes, and murders
filled the lives of Dávila and his men. Their wanderings lay mainly in the region
of the province of Bakhalal. (Cogolludo, lib. ii, cap. viii.) Chablé and Villa Real
de Chetemal were the places they most often visited. In many cases villages were
found to be deserted. All through the discouraging period Dávila was seeking for
some means of letting Montejo know the straits he was in. Once more he found Indians
whom he believed to be willing to act as messengers, and once again he was tricked.
Worse even than this was the unmistakable evidence that the Indians were making
elaborate preparations to attack Villa Real. The fact that one of their own chiefs
was being held as a hostage for the safe delivery of the letters did not seem to
deter them in the least. One fortunate circumstance, however, does appear in this
mass of misfortunes: Dávila was forewarned of his danger, for he sent out Francisco
Vazquez with ten men in seven canoes to get supplies. Two of the party were killed
by Indians; the remainder returned to Villa Real with at least a small amount of
supplies.</p>
<p class="normal">If Dávila and his men were badly off in Villa Real, Montejo and his party
at Chichen Itza were equally if not more precariously situated. The chief causes
of their misfortunes were the lack of men, and of the most common necessities, the
want of certainty as to the best course to be followed, and the knowledge on the
part of the Indians that the number of the Spaniards was daily growing less on account
of the ceaseless skirmishes. Food was so scarce that parties had to be formed on
purpose to make sallies from the fortifications in search of it. As Cogolludo (p.
86) graphically puts it, &quot;Their dinners now cost them their life-blood.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Although,
as we have already seen, centralized power was at an end long since in the peninsula,
a revival of the old-time feeling of unity is to be seen in the determination the
Mayas had to get rid of the Spaniards. Cogolludo (p. 87) says, &quot;For this purpose
almost all the people of that land had made an agreement, so that the multitude
[of Indians] was very great. The Indians who led the attack were of a vigorous and
proud nature, and so, confident in their great number, they surrounded the Spaniards,
who, in no direction, could be reached by help.&quot; At length, seeing themselves faced
with the choice of dying by inches from starvation or of being put to death fighting
their enemies bravely, the Spaniards determined to make a sally when as good an
opportunity as possible should present itself. Both sides were desperate: the invaders
were fighting for their lives; the Indians for their liberty. The havoc wrought
by the superior arms of the Spaniards was, however, more than counterbalanced by
the overwhelming numbers of the Indians. At last, seeing the utter hopelessness
of further efforts, Montejo gave the signal to retreat. One hundred and fifty soldiers
died at the hands of the Indians in this engagement. An anecdote which Cogolludo
tells as an explanation of the unity and determination of the Indians is a possible
light upon the cause of their resistance. A cacique named Cupul, in the early days
of the Spanish occupation of Chichen Itza, feigned friendliness toward the invaders
and went about freely among them. One day, when Montejo was off his guard, Cupul
went up behind him, snatched his sword away, and tried to kill him. Fortunately
a Spaniard, one Bias Gonzalez, cut off Cupul&#39;s arm just in time to prevent the blow.
It was to avenge the injury thus done to a chief that the Indians shut off the Spaniards&#39;
food supply. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Chichen Itza and Villa Real both Deserted</b>. For our purpose
it is unnecessary to give further details of the first expedition of Montejo. We
need only say that both the settlements made by the Spaniards, Chichen Itza and
Villa Real de Chetemal, were deserted for the time being. Cogolludo, after reviewing
the various accounts of the further wanderings of Montejo and his son, Francisco
Montejo the Younger, comes to the conclusion that the son remained at a port called
Zilam, while his father went by sea to Campeche (Kin Pech), where he remained till
1534 without entirely deserting Yucatan. He did go, however, to New Spain in an
effort to get more men so that he might continue the conquest. Those whom he already
had remained at Campeche. Cogolludo&#39;s authority for these statements are the depositions
written by Gonzalo Nieto and Bias Gonzalez, who were two soldiers of the Adelantado&#39;s
forces. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Dávila Goes to Honduras</b>. Captain Alonso Dávila stayed in Villa
Real de Chetemal until 1532, constantly suffering from hunger and his struggles
with the natives. His efforts to communicate with the Adelantado were constant.
Finally it was decided to move to some place nearer Honduras. As no suitable place
for a settlement was found, Dávila and his followers went to the town of Trujillo
in Honduras. On the journey they lacked for every comfort and even for proper food.
When they reached Trujillo they found the people there little better off than they.
Dávila agreed with Andrés de Zerezeda, who was governing Trujillo, that a vessel
should be built to be sent out in search of the Adelantado and also for things from
Spain. At about this time two ships from Cuba brought news of the discovery of Peru,
and in one of these ships Dávila and his men went off. Ultimately they rejoined
the Adelantado at Campeche.</p>
<p class="normal">Even after he was rejoined by Dávila and his followers
at Campeche, Montejo still had plenty of trouble with the natives. Like all the
rest, the Indians of Campeche were bitterly opposed to the Spaniards and gave them
much trouble. It is pleasant to know that Queen Juana recognized the sacrifices
made by Montejo in a cedula given at Ocaña on April 24, 1534. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Elder Montejo Goes to Tabasco in 1535</b>. Nothing daunted
by all his misfortunes, the Adelantado bought some ships and gathered some soldiers
to continue his conquest. In New Spain, also, he obtained new supplies of munitions
and other necessary things. Apparently Montejo the Elder was ordered to pacify the
province of Tabasco, which was in revolt. As a result of this Tabasco became, and
for a long time remained, a part of the province of Yucatan. The ships, under Gonzalo
Nieto, went on to Campeche to get all the Spaniards there were in Yucatan and bring
them to Tabasco, for the subjugating of that province was found to be more difficult
than had at first been thought. The motive which led Montejo thus to make sure of
his grasp on Tabasco speaks well for his generalship: he knew only too well how
few were the men available as fighters, and so he wished to make sure that there
were no revolted provinces in his rear at the time when he should begin again his
attack on Yucatan.</p>
<p class="normal">In the year 1535 the Spaniards deserted Yucatan proper, retiring
to Champoton<a name="div2Ref_4.4" href="#div2_4.4"><sup>4.4</sup></a>] and to Tabasco. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Franciscans Enter Yucatan, 1535</b>. At this juncture a very
important incident took place: the Religious of the Order of San Francisco entered
Yucatan. (Cogolludo, lib. ii, cap. 12.) At that time, 1534-1535, Antonio de Mendoza<a name="div2Ref_4.5" href="#div2_4.5"><sup>4.5</sup></a>
was in possession of the post of Viceroy of New Spain, and he had long before received
orders from Queen Juana signed at Madrid, September 22, 1530, to the effect that
Religious must at once be sent to Yucatan to fulfill the conditions under which
that province had been granted to Francisco de Montejo. As there were no Religious
in Yucatan there was nothing for Mendoza to do but send some from his own dominions.
When the project was made known it was answered by Fray Jacobo de Testera, who,
although he was the occupant of a high post in Mexico, offered to go to Yucatan
to evangelize the country. In 1531 he, with Fray Lorencio de Bienvenida and two
others, went to Tabasco. On March 18 of the same year they reached Champoton. Having
asked leave of the natives to enter, the Mexican Indians in the party were welcomed
by those of Champoton. The beginning was fortunate enough; the end of the mission
was unfortunate. The cause of the change was the resentment the Indians felt against
the Padres, who burned up their idols. Campeche was the farthest point from Mexico
that they reached. (Remesal, lib. v, cap. 6.) Disgruntled by their failure, the
Padres finally returned to Mexico. Cogolludo is very explicit as regards the exaggeration
of Spanish cruelty by some writers, notably Remesal, Las Casas, and others.</p>
<p class="normal">In 1536
another band of friars, led by Fray Antonio de Ciudad-Rodrigo, preached in Coazacoalco,
Santa Maria de la Victoria de Tabasco, Xicalango, Champoton, and Campeche, returning
to New Spain two years later. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Renewal of the Subjection of Yucatan by Montejo, 1537</b>. Cogolludo
(lib. iii, cap. 1) expatiates upon the difficulty of setting an accurate date for
the renewal of the pacification of Yucatan. It is plain enough, however, that Montejo
wisely decided to begin this time with Tabasco, on which he already had a hold.
This was accomplished with the aid of Diego de Contreras with a ship, men, and supplies.
The task was completed by 1537. In all his undertakings Montejo seems to have been
hampered by a scarcity of men, which may, as Cogolludo suggests, be accounted for
by the recent discovery of Peru, with its alleged great wealth. There is some doubt
as to whether Francisco de Montejo or his son led this second expedition; Cogolludo
suggests that the former may have gone to Yucatan in person to start the work and
that he may then have returned to Tabasco, leaving his son in charge. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Hostility of the Indians</b>. Champoton was the place selected
for the Spanish headquarters. The camp was established there in 1537. Mochcovoh,
Halach Uinic of the place, treated them well at first. (Landa, pp. 82-83.) Before
very long, however, the latent hostility of the Indians burst out and there was
a battle which resulted in the flight of the Indians. The Spaniards foolishly neglected
to follow up this advantage, preferring to bury their not numerous dead. In the
days which followed there was a cessation of hostilities, which seems to have misled
the Spaniards, who thought that the Indians were cowed. As a matter of fact they
were forming a great army composed of warriors from many neighboring districts.
In the battle which was soon precipitated the Spaniards were driven to their ships,
and the royal camp was sacked. Stung and enraged by the insults of the seemingly
victorious Indians, the Spaniards turned and faced them so boldly that the victory,
in the end, was a Spanish one. Most of the Spaniards went home to their lands in
New Spain after this battle; nineteen, however, remained at Champoton waiting for
an opportunity to proceed with the conquest. Several of the names of these intrepid
adventurers are given by Cogolludo (p. 117). They all speak, In their Relaciones,
of the younger Montejo as a good leader.</p>
<p class="normal">Matters continued for some time in very
much the same way as heretofore. Towns were founded; troubles with the Indians occurred;
the Adelantado went back and forth between Tabasco and Champoton; Don Francisco
Montejo the Younger went to New Spain to get more soldiers, things went on in a
fairly satisfactory manner until 1539, when, with some twenty cavalrymen from New
Spain, Don Francisco went to Campeche. At about this time the chief command and
the powers laid upon him by the king were passed by the Adelantado Francisco de
Montejo to his son of the same name. The Instructions of the Adelantado are so important
that we will give an extract of them paragraph by paragraph as described by Cogolludo.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Elder Montejo&#39;s Instructions to his Son</b></p>
<p class="normal">1. You, my son
Don Francisco de Montejo, are to do the following in your conquest of Yucatan and
Cozumel and in your fulfillment of the powers which I hold from His Majesty.</p>
<p class="normal">2.
You are to see that your men live like good Christians and speak well of God, and
you are to punish wrong-doers.</p>
<p class="normal">3. On your arrival at San Pedro (Champoton) you are
to punish any who may have enslaved Indians against their will, and you are to thank
the Indians of Champoton for having treated our men so well for two and one-half
years.</p>
<p class="normal">4. Leaving the Indians of Champoton well contented, and taking with you some
of their chief men, you will go to Campeche, where you will tell the leaders that
you have come to take that land in His Majesty&#39;s name and mine in order to win it
for the Holy Faith. You will punish those who will have no knowledge of God and
who will not obey His Majesty. Those who do come into the faith and are obedient
you will favor and shelter. Then, taking two chiefs of the said <i>Pueblo</i> and two
of that of Champoton, you will let the rest go home; thereupon you will enter the
province of Acanul, taking great care to do no harm to the natives.</p>
<p class="normal">5. In this province
you will endeavor to meet a Lord called Vua Chancan, who has always been a friend
of the Christians and most helpful in time of war. You will treat him very well,
and will try to find out through the other leaders of the province whether they
wish war. And if they do, you will give them to understand that you come in peace
and that if they receive you in His Majesty&#39;s name and mine they will be well treated
and favored. If they do not yield you will have to make war upon them.</p>
<p class="normal">6. Having
arrived at the <i>Pueblo</i> of Tihoo, which is in the province of Quepeche, you will
establish there a <i>Cabildo</i> and Government if it seems to you that the region is
such as to favor it. There you will labor to bring the whole land to peace, and
if some hold back you will make war upon them in fulfillment of His Majesty&#39;s commands.</p>
<p class="normal">7. Afterwards you are to pacify the provinces which are to serve the said City.
They are those of Acanul, Chacan, Quepeche, Kin Chel, Cocola, Tutul Xiu, and Kupules;
these are the greatest provinces of the land.</p>
<p class="normal">8. You are to give <i>repartimientos</i>
to not more than one hundred men because the land is large and the Indians many.
This city is to be the chief of all. Besides the <i>repartimientos</i> which you make
and besides that which I have kept for myself, you will leave a number of villages,
without giving them permanently, for the use of persons who most forward the service
of His Majesty. It is customary to do so in new lands.</p>
<p class="normal">9. And you are to make a
general inspection of all that you conquer in the provinces hereinbefore mentioned;
you will especially be informed of the number and quality of villages and houses.
In each village you will establish Spanish citizens suitable for each village. You
will also make <i>Cedulas</i> of <i>encomienda</i> and <i>repartimiento</i> wherever you think
best, in fulfillment of His Majesty&#39;s command.</p>
<p class="normal">10. And having done all this, you
will labor to see to it that all build their houses and other buildings well, and
you the first of all, so that others may take your example. And you will endeavor
to see that the Indians are well treated and taught our Holy Catholic Faith and
are made to lose their bad habits.</p>
<p class="normal">11. At the same time you are to open roads to
the sea and between all the principal cities. In all this you will place all the
diligence and care possible, because I trust you. Signed in this Royal City of Chiapa,
1540.</p>
<p class="normal">12. Furthermore you will grant me again the provinces of Tutul Xiu, Techaque,
Campeche and the village of Champoton. </p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><b>The Younger Montejo Founds Campeche, 1540-1541</b>. Before setting
out with the main body of his forces Don Francisco de Montejo, the son, sent four
picked men in advance to Campeche to ascertain the attitude of the Indians. At a
place called Cihoo in the province of Telchac (Cogolludo, pp. 126, 127) these scouts
found some Indians fortified. They warned the army of the danger. A fight took place
in which the Spaniards were the victors. They took the Indians&#39; deserted town and
recuperated there for a number of days. From Cihoo, Montejo went to Campeche, where
he established the town of San Francisco de Campeche in 1540 or 1541.</p>
<p class="normal">All that was
necessary for the establishment of government at Campeche having been done, it was
time for Don Francisco to attend to the founding of Merida at Tihoo. He sent his
cousin with fifty-seven or so men to conquer it; he himself remained behind. There
was some trouble with the Indians, and it transpired that the friendship of a chief
named Na Chancan, Lord of Acanul, was feigned. The Spaniards passed through the
village of Pokbac. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Tutul Xiu of Mani Offers his Aid</b>. Having reached Tihoo, the
Spaniards established their camp on a hill near the present cathedral. (Cogolludo,
lib. iii, cap. 6.) They had not been there long when some Indians brought the news
that a large war-party was about to attack them. The Spaniards resolved to be the
aggressors; they went in search of their enemies and beat them in a sharp fight.
On his return to Tihoo, Montejo set his followers to work building the town. They
were soon interrupted once more, this time by the arrival of the Lord of Mani, who
came in peace. Voluntarily he submitted to Spanish authority and asked to be made
a Christian. As it was the day of San Ildefonso, Archbishop of Toledo, the new town
was placed under his patronage because of this good fortune. The date was February
23, 1541. Tutul Xiu said that he had been won over by the valor of the Spaniards.</p>
<p class="normal">Accompanying the Lord of Mani (Tutul Xiu) were numerous vassals whose names are
interesting for us. I give the spelling of Cogolludo (pp. 130-131). They were: Ah
Na Poot Xiu, son of Tutul Xiu; Ah Ziyah, a governor; and Ah Kin Chi, a priest. These
three are said to have been lieutenants of Tutul Xiu at Mani itself. Others of the
vassals were: Yi Ban Can, Governor of the pueblo of TeKit; Pacab, Governor of Oxcutzcab;
Kan Caba of Panabchen, which is now deserted; Kupul of Zacalum; Nauat of Teab; Uluac
Chan Cauich, whose home is unknown; Zon Ceh of Pencuyut; Ahau Tuyu of Muna; Xul
Cumche of TipiKal; Tucuch of Mama; Zit Couat of Chumayel. Just before he left, Tutul
Xiu promised to send ambassadors of his to other great lords in the country urging
them to accept Christianity and Spanish sovereignty. He did as he said he would.
Ambassadors were sent to the Cocomes of Zotuta and to other chiefs. The chief of
Zotuta at this time was Nachi Cocom; he killed all the ambassadors save Ah Kin Chi,
who was sent back to Mani with the news.</p>
<p class="normal">While the Indians of Mani and those of Zotuta were at odds, a number of Indians from the country around Tihoo came to yield
obedience to the Spaniards. Warned by their ally, the Spaniards learned that Nachi
Cocom had made a league against the Spaniards, comprising all the people from the
country east of Tihoo as far as Ytzamal. In the end, according to Cogolludo (p.
137), no less than seventy thousand hostile Indians came against the Spaniards.
As a result of the great battle that took place the main part of the Indians&#39; resistance
was destroyed. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Foundation of Merida and of Valladolid, 1542-1543</b>. On the Feast
of the Kings, January 6, 1542, Señor Don Francisco de Montejo and Rodrigo Alvarez,
scrivener, established the city of Merida with the entire province of Quepech subject
to it. Aside from its Indian population, however, Merida had only one hundred citizens.
Cogolludo (p. 137) gives a complete list of the first Alcaldes and Regidores.</p>
<p class="normal">On
March 13, 1542, Montejo made arrangements for the founding of the city of Valladolid,
a task which he intrusted to one of his relatives. In May of the same year he himself
set forth from Merida to subdue the Cocomes of Zotuta or Sotuta, while at the same
time another relative went to conquer the province of Choaca, the inhabitants of
which were very warlike. After more or less resistance the Cocomes were beaten and
the city of Zotuta fell into Spanish hands.</p>
<p class="normal">On January 1, 1543, the Cabildo elected
the second set of municipal officers for Merida. From that time the city increased
in permanency; <i>solares</i> or lots were given out; the Spanish rule was firm.</p>
<p class="normal">On May
28, 1543, the city of Valladolid in the province of Choaca was founded and a church
was established, the town being placed under the protection of Nuestra Señora de
los Remedios. Cogolludo (lib. iii, cap. 14) gives a full list of all the officers
and citizens.</p>
<p class="normal">It is uncertain where the site of the first settlement of Valladolid
is. It is quite certain, however, that the city was soon moved from its first position
&quot;six leagues from the sea.&quot; The reason why the site was changed was the unhealthful
locality in which the first settlement was placed. The new site was the <i>pueblo</i>
of Zaqui, where the present city of Valladolid now stands. In 1544 the city of Salamanca
de Bacalar was founded on or near the site of Bakhalal. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas Arrives in Yucatan</b>. At this time,
1544-1545, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas and his friars of the Order of Santo Domingo
arrived in Yucatan, going first to Campeche and later spreading their influence
through the country, the natives of which greatly needed improvement. From this
time onwards we may consider that the Spanish rule was firmly established throughout
the northern portions of the peninsula, although, as we shall see, a long time was
still to pass before the southern regions were subjected. Montejo and those associated
with him came no nearer to the Itzas than Bakhalal. All this is not meant to imply
that there were no further revolts and resistance against Spanish authority, for
there still were sporadic efforts on the part of the Indians to maintain their freedom.
In Valladolid, for example, in the year 1546, there was a very serious rebellion,
which was crushed only with great difficulty. (Landa, p. 93.) In general, nevertheless,
Spanish power daily grew more firm, and the power of the Religious grew constantly
greater, despite hostility from both Spaniards and Indians.</p>

<h2><a name="div1Ref_5.0" href="#div1_5.0">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<h3>THE ENTRADA OF PADRES FUENSALIDA AND<br>
ORBITA, 1618</h3>
<p class="continue">THE next entrada was made by two members of the Franciscan Order,
which has done so much in many parts of the world to bring unbelievers into the
Church. As we shall very shortly see, their coming inaugurated a new period in the
conquest of the Itzas.</p>
<p class="normal">From lack of any sort of information we must assume that
from 1524 to 1614 the Itzas of Tayasal or Peten were unmolested by Spaniards. There
are numerous hints of their formidableness during this period, and the event of
which we shall soon learn shows that they were not without a certain grim humor.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Name Canek</b>. Cortes, when he visited Peten, found the governmental
power in the hands of a personage bearing the name or title of Canek. Cogolludo
and Villagutierre both say that this term was a name arrived at by combining the
family names of the ruler&#39;s parents. This seems to me difficult to believe. Rather,
I think the word Canek to be a title. My reason for so thinking is this: in 1524
the ruler was called Canek, and ninety years later the then ruler was also Canek.
It could hardly have been the same individual, and it is equally unlikely that the
parents of two rulers should have exactly the same name. It is possible, of course,
that the first king of Peten or Tayasal had the name of Canek, derived as the two
historians suggest, and that this family name later took on the attributes of a
title. The same thing happened in the case of the Pharaohs, the Seleucidae, the
Roman emperors (Caesar), and the Incas.</p>
<p class="normal">While the northern part of the peninsula
was being made a Spanish dominion, the southern woodland remained unconquered, causing
much annoyance to the authorities. If we look upon the year 1545 as marking the
completion of the conquest of northern Yucatan, we may say that a century and a
half elapsed before the subjection of the Itzas was consummated. To gain an idea
of the events of the time we can do nothing better than to give Villagutierre&#39;s
account. (Lib. ii, cap. 1.) </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Increased Power of the Itzas</b>. &quot;It is now many years that the
Barbarous Itzaex,<a name="div2Ref_5.1" href="#div2_5.1"><sup>5.1</sup></a> more than any other Nation of Infidels, have been terrifying
all those Provinces. For, since the time when D. Fernando Cortes passed through
their land and those events which have already been told happened to them, no further
attempts had been made to bring about their Reduction or to make war upon them in
order to subjugate them, and this was on account of the prohibition given by the
King in Cedulas and orders.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They had increased greatly in numbers, pride, cruelty
and Power, making war upon and capturing and eating others of the Gentile Nations
who dwelt in those Mountains and Forests, and also infesting, by their Raids, the
Reduced and quiet Villages on the Confines of their Lands, and especially those
of the Province of Yucatan, destroying them, and causing the Indians and Spaniards
great agitation.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They trusted in the great Fortress and the great security they
had in their Lake, and especially at the City or Great Village of Tayassal which
was situated on the Peten or Island in the Lake; because of which nothing molested
them nor was it possible even to pass near their Confines. And although the Governors
of the Province of Yucatan regretted this extremely, yet they did not venture to
make war upon them because the King had prohibited it by his orders and Royal Cedulas,
as has been said elsewhere.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Mock Embassy from Tayasal</b>. &quot;In the year 1614, while Don
Antonio de Figueroa was governing those Provinces of Yucatan, some of the Itzaex
came to the City of Merida, feigning an embassy (?) in order to cover other and
more private ends. Or perhaps because it seemed to them that they could thereby
make derision or sport of the Spaniards, they gave out that they had come voluntarily
to render obedience to His Majesty, and in his Name to the Governor of those Provinces,
saying that their King and Lord, Canek, and all his Vassals, were desirous of the
Friendship of the Spaniards and were coming to ask for Peace.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;As nothing was to
be lost thereby the Governor believed them, and received their obedience which they
gave. He appointed Justices from among themselves, and gave them the usual Staffs
of Alcaldes; and having shown them all sorts of kindness he let them go, well pleased.
And the Governor was well-satisfied, judging that now they would voluntarily be
his subjects and that they would be Christians. But later it was seen that all this
was a fantastic make-believe, poured out in the Mould of their mendacious evilness,
which they frequently indulged in, as we shall see further on.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Governor, considering
it as an insult to His Majesty and to himself, or else being zealous or piqued by
the sly treatment given by those Barbarous Infidels, in order to convert them and
knowing that he could not make war upon them, he appealed to the Council of the
Indies, asking that the Authority be granted to him to overcome and subject them
by force of arms. And he pointed out the continuousness of their wickedness, the
perfidy of their idolatry, the wariness of their tricks, the terror and fear in
which they held those Provinces, and what was necessary in order to punish and subject
them by force.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Mock Embassy Considered to be a Rebellion</b>. &quot;Especially,
since they had now given their obedience (though pretendingly) and since they had
departed from it, the prohibition to make War on them was at an end. For, if His
Majesty had indeed so prohibited War, these Indians were now Vassals of the King,
and failure in vassalage was a species of Rebellion and Uprising. And if they had
given their obedience feigningly and craftily or with any improper end, it was a
piece of rudeness worthy of not being left without very severe chastisement.<a name="div2Ref_5.2" href="#div2_5.2"><sup>5.2</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal">&quot;It does not appear whether this Governor divined what was to occur in the future
from the obstinacy, cruelty, and malevolence of these Barbarians, and how many efficacious
Means were to be insufficient to reduce them to Peace; but that of War (is the best).
But he pressed for permission to make use of it in order to bring them to subjection.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Here it may be well to compare Cogolludo&#39;s account of these same events with that
of Villagutierre. Cogolludo (lib. ix, cap. 1) says that these events took place
in the reign of Bishop Don Fray Gonzalo de Salazar. In 1609 a great plague did much
harm in Yucatan. In 1610, at the end of August, Salazar arrived to take the post
of Bishop of Yucatan. At about that time two Indians called Alonzo Chable and Francisco
Canul gave out that they were respectively the Pope and the Bishop, and they made
the wretched Catholic Indians venerate them as such. All the most sacred mysteries
of the Church were profaned by them, even the Host itself. This deplorable state
of affairs was brought to an end by the intervention of the Governor of the village
of Tikax in the sierra. He was one Don Pedro Xiu, a descendant of Tutul Xiu, Lord
of Mani. Owing, perhaps, to the influence of a convent in his region, this chief
was a good Christian, and he severely punished the offenders for their sacrilege.
He even forced the Spaniards to attend Mass. In short his virtue was such as to
earn him the hatred of all malcontents. Finally, being pursued by his enemies, the
cacique sought refuge in the convent of Tikax, the guardian of which was the Reverend
Padre Fray Juan de Coronel.<a name="div2Ref_5.3" href="#div2_5.3"><sup>5.3</sup></a> Xiu was hidden behind the sacristy altar while
the search was going forward. In due time the more orderly portion of the Spanish
population came to the aid of the cacique, and his enemies were put to death by
order of the Governor of Yucatan, who at this time was the Mariscal Don Carlos de
Luna y Arellano. His qualities as a governor receive the following terse tribute
from Cogolludo: &quot;His term of office completed, he came forth from his post in debt,
whereas others, in a short while, pay great debts and come forth very rich.&quot; Luna
had been rich when he went into office. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>A New Period in the History of the Itzas</b>. We have now reached
a sort of natural break in our history. Beginning with a review of the pre-conquest
history of the Mayas and of the Itzas, we have studied the entradas of Cortes, of
Montejo, and of Dávila into the regions formerly occupied by them. We have seen
the manner in which the northern portions of Yucatan and of the Maya-Itza stock
were made subject to the crown of Castile; we have just examined the best two accounts
of the events leading up to the conquest of the southern tribes, and especially
of the Itzas of Tayasal. From the year 1614, which we have now reached, the main
interest centers about the small nation whose chief town was at Tayasal on Lake
Peten. They and their subject tribes resisted the Spanish onslaughts from 1614 to
1697. It took eighty-three years for the Spaniards to subject this nation, which
cannot have numbered more than one hundred and fifty thousand souls. The Itzas resisted
successfully for a much longer time a power more their superior than was that of
Caesar to that of the Gauls.</p>
<p class="normal">Having noticed the beginning of a new period, we will
continue the translation of Villagutierre. We shall thus see how the conquest of
the Itzas began as a more or less desultory evangelical affair, and how no real
vigor was injected into it until a commercial motive (the building of the Yucatan-Guatemala
road) was introduced. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Fuensalida and Orbita</b>. The account continues thus:</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Three or
four years later, when the year 1618 was already running its course, on the 25th
of March, while Francisco Ramirez Briceño was governing these Provinces, the Provincial
Chapter of the Religious Order of San Francisco was held in the City of Merida;
before it, ... Padres Fray Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Fray Juan de Orbita offered
to go and preach the Holy Evangel to the Itzaex; both of these were Learned Men
and of consummate Virtue, they were Priests well versed in that Maya Tongue which
was natural to those Itzaex as to the Yucatecs, where they had been before.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;...
It was determined that they should set forth on that Holy Errand; and they, well
pleased, and trusting in God, determined to depart without delay and without other
arms than the loving force of the Divine Word, thus fulfilling the will of the King
that only Religious should go, and without the clangor of Soldiery. The Provincial
gave them their patents which were presented before the Bishop, Don Gonzalo de Salazar,
who was so overjoyed at their holy resolution that had his presence not been needed
for the Government of his Bishopric, he would have gone with the Padres.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Since
this could not be, the Bishop despatched to them with great pleasure very ample
Authority, in which he gave them as much Power over the Spaniards as they would
have had if he had been present with them; and especially in regard to the People
of the Town of Salamanca de Bacalar and its territory, commanding the Beneficiado
of that Town and District, which includes Tipu, under penalty of the greater Excommunication,
in no manner direct or indirect to embarrass or to expel the Religious while they
were in Tipu, from which point they were to make ready for their Entrada to the
Itzaex.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Briceño&#39;s Opposition</b>. &quot;And the Bishop perceived that the Religious
were going without attention to temporal matters, for the Governor Francisco Ramirez
Briceño, in spite of His Majesty&#39;s command that in such Cases the Necessary Funds
for the Divine Worship and the Viaticum for the Religious should be given from the
Royal Chest, did not wish to give anything to these men; nor did he wish to give
them even the Despatch for which they asked in order that the Villages through which
they passed might give them assistance, his excuse being that he did not have orders
from the King, and that if they were killed by the Barbarians or by some Native
Indians they had with them, or if any other misfortune should come to pass, the
Blame would be upon him. The Bishop gave them, beside the Appointment, orders and
aids which I have spoken of, many Crosses, Knives, Shears and other trifles and
Charms from Spain so that they might treat the Indians well; and he comforted them,
and put new life into their zeal for this good purpose.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Citizens of Merida
joined the Bishop in his joy and also in giving the Padres increased Alms; and the
Former Governor Don Antonio de Figueroa gave them Rosaries, and Glass Beads, and
the Citizens gave them these and many other things, and still others were bought
with the Alms contributed by the <i>Encomenderos</i>. Even the Indians of the City and
the Villages through which they later passed, the Chiefs, and Indian Women, gave
them Clothing of the sort they were wont to use for the improvement [of the Itzas],
in order that they might be given to the King Canek and to his Wife and to the other
Chiefs of the Itzas.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Set out</b>. &quot;The present Governor alone, Briceño, gave
them nothing, and he even swindled them out of the Despatch of Favor and Assistance,
saying that he would give it to them the day of their departure; then he said that
they should wait for it at the Convent of Tikax, which is the last one in the Sierra.
So that without the Despatch, but with the Blessing of God and that of the Bishop
and their own Prelate, and asking all to recommend to God the good outcome of the
Voyage, they set out from Merida for Bacalar, rejoicing, and on naked feet.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In
a short space of time they arrived at the Convent of Tikax, for they feared that
the rains would begin. When they had waited some days for the Despatches of the
Governor, they received only a letter from him in which he said that he did not
intend to give them the Despatches for the reasons he had already given them. The
Padres greatly regretted the coldness on the part of the Governor merely because
they feared that they would not have in Bacalar good Aid without the orders of the
Governor; for it was necessary to take Boats from there to go up the Rivers from
that Town to the Village of Tipu, where they were to make their Headquarters, according
to the instructions of the Bishop.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Their Route</b>. &quot;But nevertheless, and confiding only in God,
they continued their journey accompanied by some Indian Singers and Sacristans who
were at the Convent and whom God moved to offer themselves as companions, although
they knew the perils of the journey, and thus they went alone, without human defense,
to place themselves in the hands of those Barbarous Caribes,<a name="div2Ref_5.4" href="#div2_5.4"><sup>5.4</sup></a> of whom it was
known for certain that they ate human Flesh; but they placed all fear behind them.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And the Padres, seeing that they had with them those who would aid them to celebrate
the Divine Services solemnly, traveled very contentedly. They arrived at Calotmul,
five leagues from the Convent. And on leaving this Village, they traversed the Sierra
to the Village of Chunhuhub, which is another fifteen leagues of deserted country
full of swamps and marshes very difficult to cross. From there they journeyed to
Pacha, another fifteen leagues of deserted country, with roads even worse than those
before on account of their very swampy nature, which is so great that in the rainy
season it is necessary to take to Canoes in order to pass those Places, and in the
dry season the Canoes are beached there.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;From the Village of Pacha they went to
another called Xoca, almost another ten leagues. This place was later deserted and
overgrown with trees. From Xoca they went to the Town of Salamanca de Bacalar, which
is five leagues. And there they were regaled and favored by the Alcalde, who, at
that time, was Andres Carrillo de Pernia, a Citizen of the Town of Valladolid de
Yucatan, who showed so much hospitality and kindliness while they were there to
them and to the Indians whom they had with them, that in nowise were they made to
feel the want of Despatches from the Governor of Yucatan; for he gave them more
favors and assistance then and later, this Alcalde, than if they had carried the
Commands, orders and Despatches of all the Tribunals of the World.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Notwithstanding
the great favors which the Alcalde Carrillo showed to the Missionaries, they desired
to set forth with all speed for Tipu so as not to be overtaken by the Rains; and
as they found themselves, like true Sons of Saint Francis, without any money with
which to pay the Indian Rowers who were to conduct them, and with which to buy the
ship-stores necessary for all in order to navigate the Rio Nohukun, which means
Rio Grande, in order to go up by the river to Tipu, and not being able to ask aid
of the Alcalde because of the absence of orders from the Governor, they were saddened
and became exceedingly disconsolate.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;But the Noble Zeal of that Honorable Creole, Alcalde Carrillo, once more aided them. Learning the cause of their sadness, because
the Holy Eagerness which they had was not cooled, he provided a <i>Piragua</i> of his
own, very capacious, with Indian rowers and Supplies necessary for all. And not
content with having fitted them out, he embarked with them and accompanied them
in person as far as Tipu so that the Indians should not leave them, and so that
aid should be offered more promptly; and all this was done at the expense of his
estate without being necessitated by orders from any Superior.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Journey up the
River from Tipu</b>. &quot;They made the Navigation of that great River and of others which
flow into it, with great contentment on account of the deliciousness of its Banks,
Isles, great and wide-spread Lagoons, Woodlands, Forests, and Pine Groves which
spread away as far as New Spain. And what caused them no less diversion was the
Indians of the <i>Piragua</i>, who, without stopping the boat, continually captured Fishes
with Harpoons; the only thing that annoyed them was the multitude of Mosquitoes
which there are thereabouts and which caused them much pain and disquiet.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;To refer
in detail to the Events and Places through which they passed either by Water or
by Land, would be too much of prolixity, and it is not intended to do more than
to let it be known from what will be said later, that from the City of Merida to
the District and Village of Tipu it is a very long, and at times, toilsome Journey.
And so it is sufficient to say that in three days, (after many of Traveling), they
mounted the ascent to Tipu by the River which comes from there and which is very
full. And as the going is against the current, which is of so much violence, in
those twelve leagues that to go up to Tipu the Oars are not sufficient and it is
necessary to go up by means of Poles; and at every mischance the Water whirls the
Canoes backward; and at times the Indians throw themselves upon them with arms outstretched
to stop them and to draw them forward....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The account of these events given by Cogolludo (lib. ix, caps. 4, 5, 6) is almost identical. The place names mentioned
by Villagutierre are all to be found on Costello&#39;s map (MacNutt, 1908, vol. ii,
p. 232) save Pacha (between Chunhuhub and Xoca). The distances from place to place
are inaccurately given by Villagutierre, being invariably too short. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Arrival at Tipu</b>. We will now continue by translating Villagutierre.
(Lib. ii, cap. 2 ff.)</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Alcaldes, Caziques and Chief Men of Tipu learned before
their arrival that the Padres were coming to their Village, and they set forth with
their Canoes to go more than two leagues down the River to receive them with Refreshments
in Food and a Drink called <i>Zaca</i>, which they make of Cacao and Maize. They saluted
the Padres with much contentment and joy, and they returned with them to the Landing
place, a stone&#39;s throw from the Village, and there they had prepared Dances according
to their usage, and to the accompaniment of these and much rejoicing, they took
the Padres to the Church, where they offered up to God their thanks for having permitted
them to arrive safely at that Village on the outskirts of Christendom and the Plaza
de Armas of valiant Spirits.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Events at the Village of Tipu</b>. &quot;And when they had said their
Orisons, the Indians quartered the Padres in the house of the <i>Beneficiado</i> next
to the Church and the Alcalde Carrillo was placed in the house of a leading Indian
woman, called Doña Isabel Pec, who was the Widow of the Cacique Don Luis Mazun,
who had died while a prisoner for Idolatry in Merida. When the Religious reached
this Village there were Vespers of the Feast of the Holy Ghost....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Friendliness of Carrillo and the Indians</b>. &quot;The Alcalde
Carrillo inspected the Village as it was of his jurisdiction, and not having anything
further to do there because the Citizens aided the Padres even more than was necessary,
he wished them well and took leave of them all, returning to Salamanca de Bacalar.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Padres now remained alone with the Indians of Tipu, but they were very much
the companions of God and of His fervent Spirit and of the gladness which it caused
them to see those Indians so occupied with the affairs of good Christians such as
attending with much punctuality the Divine Services, sending their Children to all
the classes for the Catechism. (What passed in their hearts God alone knows, as
will be told later.) The Padres saw that the Indians aided them with much generosity
as time went on and until they set forth for the Itzaex, because the people of Tipu
were very rich and got much Cacao, Vanilla and other things of a noble sort.&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Don Christoval Na, Cacique of the Indians of Tipu</b>. &quot;There were
then in the Vicinity of the Village of Tipu more than one hundred Citizens,<a name="div2Ref_5.5" href="#div2_5.5"><sup>5.5</sup></a>
all Indians. Don Christobal Na, their Cacique, was very devoted to the Religious.
There was another Chief Indian called Don Francisco Cumux, who was a Descendant
of the Lord of the Island of Cozumel, who received Don Fernando Cortes when he passed
to the Conquest of New Spain. This man in his Habits, and actions showed very well
his Nobility and good Blood, although he was but an Indian. He was very much the
Servitor of the Padres and a great Singer, and he was often present in the Church,
singing the Offices, as if he were a common Indian.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It was decided to send Cumux
to the Itzas to ascertain their attitude toward the Padres. &quot;... Cumux accepted
the Embassy with a very good will, although he was not eager for the danger; and
when all had been made ready he set forth with the Indians that were assigned to
him. The contents of the message were: To say to the Canek how the two Padres had
remained in Tipu and that the reason they had gone thither was to pass to [the Itzas]
to see and communicate certain things which were for the good of Canek and his people;
and so the Ambassador was to ask him to assemble his Captains in order that they
might see that their coming was a peaceful one, without Soldiers or arms, only two
Poor Padres of San Francisco; and Canek was urged to send his Chief Men to see them
at Tipu, and they said that they would like, with his leave and permission and safe-conduct
to pass to see him, and that if he gave it, as they hoped, it would give them great
pleasure, for without his consent they would do nothing.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Francisco Cumux Goes with an Embassy to Canek</b>. &quot;Don Francisco
Cumux set forth on his Journey, very well-pleased; he traversed those Mountains
and deserts, leaving the Padres in the hands of God and making continual Sacrifices
and Orisons. He was six days in arriving at the Island, Capital of the Itzas; and
when he was brought into the presence of Canek, he was received with affability,
and he gave his message as he had been ordered. The Itzaex entertained him and those
whom he brought with him according to the quality of each one. Then Canek called
to Council all his Captains and Chiefs in order to consider what he should reply
to the message and Letter which the Religious had sent him.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And as some of those
Indians already knew a little of what the Religious were, through having seen them
in the City of Merida, at the time when they went there to give that false obedience
of which I have spoken, and they also knew that they could do them no harm if they
were alone as Don Francisco Cumux asserted, they resolved not only to give License
to come and see them, but also the Canek sent two Captains of his, together with
some Indians, in company with Don Francisco and his Indians, in order that they
might visit the Padres in his behalf and tell them that they might come with all
safety to his Land whenever it might please them, for he and his men were ready
to receive them and talk with them in good feeling. And with this good Reply, farewells
were said by Don Francisco Cumux, who set forth at once very happily, returning
with the rest to Tipu.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cumux Returns from Canek with Two Chiefs of Tayasal</b>. &quot;He arrived
in the presence of the Religious fifteen days after he had set out from there, greater
speed being impossible because the road was closed up and surrounded with marshes.
In his company came the two Itza Captains, one was called Ahchatappol, and the other
Ahauppuc, with more than twenty other Indians. The two Captains bore their Lances
with points of Flint, like ours, which differ from them only in being of Steel,
and at the heads of them are many Plumes of divers and beautiful colors like the
Ribbons our Standard-bearers use on their darts; and the points are as much as a
quarter of a vara long and have two cutting-edges, and the point is like a very
sharp Dagger.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The other Itzaex Indians bore their Bows and Arrows with which they
always march when they come forth from their Island and Territory in case they meet
the Chinamitas, a Nation for whom they have always had enmity, and continual wars;
for they hold themselves as brave warriors like the Itzas themselves.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Two Chiefs are cordially Received</b>. &quot;As soon as they arrived,
the two Captains saluted the Religious according to their usage (which is to throw
the right arm over the shoulder as a sign of Peace and Friendship). The Religious
replied with many urbanities and courtesies. The Captains were quartered in the
house of the Cacique and the rest in the houses of the Chiefs of that Village of
Tipu, care being taken to regale them as had been done in their Island to our Indians.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And later Don Francisco Cumux gave the Religious an account of how he had been
received by Canek and by the other Chiefs and Heads of the Districts of the City,
and of how they had shown joy and of what had gone forward, and of the opinion that
they had that the Padres should go to see the Itzas. The Padres were full of joy,
and they thanked Don Francisco and his companions for the trouble they had had on
that Journey, and they told them that it was certain that God would reward them,
for they had gone in His service and in His Holy Name....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">A rather verbose account
of the services held for the benefit of the Itzas closes this chapter. The account
of Cogolludo (lib. ix, caps. 7, 8) is much the same. Villagutierre (lib. ii, cap.
3) continues his description of the entrada of Fuensalida and Orbita: </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Prepare to Travel to Tayasal</b>. &quot;The Religious tried,
after the Itzaex Indians had gone thence, with their Indians of Tipu, to make ready
for the Journey and to prepare the necessary food for traveling. This was done in
a short while; so that on the Day of the Assumption of Our Lady, 15 August, 1618,
they set forth from Tipu in company with the Cacique of that Village, Don Christoval
Na, and with more than twenty important Indians besides those others which were
needed as servants, their <i>Maestro de Capilla</i>, their Singers and their Sacristans,
all of whom had offered to go with them from the Province....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Two leagues from Tipu, in the direction of the Itzas, there was a Great River which, because the
Waters had not risen greatly, it was possible to wade; and the Cacique, Don Christoval
Na, who was a very corpulent man of great personal strength, placed the two Religious
on his shoulders [and carried them across]. The River having been crossed, they
journeyed some eight or ten leagues, and came upon a Great Lake which they called
Yaxhaa. And finding no Canoe with which to traverse the Lake&#39;s two leagues of length,
the Indians told the Religious that they should return to the Village of Tipu, since
they could not go forward on account of the necessity of crossing the Lake, and
because of the lack of Vessels.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delays; the Padres&#39; Anger</b>. &quot;The Padre Commissario Fuensalida
became exceedingly angry with them, saying that it was not possible that they should
have been ignorant of that Impediment, since they were so well versed in that Land
and Road, and that they should have remedied it; and he declared that he would not
go back upon the Road so well begun and that he would continue upon his Journey
until he reached the Itzaex, for which place he and his Companion had set forth.
And so, as to think of floating on any makeshift was to think of the impossible,
and as to the left of that Lake it appeared that one might break through the Forest
and proceed by opening a Road [through the jungle], passing around the edge of the
Lake, they decided that they might thus continue their Voyage in a straight line.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Indians made this seem to be very difficult and they replied that it was far,
and that it would be too toilsome to open a Road through the places the Father mentioned,
and that the Supplies that they had with them were not sufficient for so many days,
and they would want for them later on. Besides the time was coming on when it would
be necessary for them to take in their crops from the fields and they said that
while they were doing that a Canoe should be built on purpose for them all to cross
the Lake and that they would carry the Padres with much pleasure and little toil
to the Itzaex.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Return to Tipu</b>. &quot;Padre Fuensalida insisted and persisted
that what he had first proposed should be executed, namely, to cut around the Lake.
And the Indians asked Padre Juan de Orbita to dissuade the Padre Commissario since
what they said was more fitting. It seemed, at last, indeed to be so, and that the
Indians were right, and all agreed to return to Tipu, and to build there a Canoe
in which to pass across the Lake as they offered to do.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;When they had returned
to Tipu, the Cacique Don Christoval soon sent Indian, carpenters who, on the very
shore of the Lake, were to make ready the wood for a very good Canoe. There are
in that region great logs of Cedar and other trees from which can be made and are
made many large Canoes. They built it very capacious and suitable; and the other
Indians, in the interim, gathered in their crops and assembled new provisions in
order to set out once more with the Padres for the Land of the Itzaex.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>All Precautions Taken, they Set out Once More</b>. &quot;Once more they
all set out as before from Tipu. They crossed the Rio Grande, which is two leagues
away, with much more trouble than before because the Waters had risen and were still
rising, as it was already near the end of September. And having arrived once more
at the Lake of Yaxhaa, where the Canoe was in readiness, the Persons who were journeying
and all that they had with them were carried across the two leagues of water in
four trips.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Lake Yaxha is Crossed; Arrival at Lake Zacpeten</b>. &quot;Everything
and everybody being now on the other bank, they continued their march by Land for
some fifteen leagues as far as another Lake, which was called Zacpeten (which is
the same as saying White Island), which was shorter than the other, being not more
than a league in length....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Here follows a short passage describing how the devil
made the Indians choose the wrong path. The reason for this suggested by Villagutierre
seems plausible, namely, that the Tipuans did not want the Itzas converted, because
if they were the Tipuans would have no place to take refuge should they themselves
become apostates.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;When the Tipuan Indians saw the Constancy of the Padres (for,
although they knew the malice of the Indians, they bore it with patience, and encouraged
them, saying that God would bring them out on the right Road since He had brought
them there) and perceiving that the intention of the Padres not to turn back was
unchanged, or else, because they saw that the Spirit of the Padres became more determined
the greater the difficulties they experienced on the way, the Indians at length
brought them out upon the right road. And after they had followed it for two days
and eighteen leagues, they came upon the Great Lake of the Itzaex called Chaltuna,
with great relief and joy.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Camp beside Lake Peten</b>. &quot;They encamped on the Shore
of the Lake and there built a very capacious Ranch in which they set up an altar
in order to say Mass. Then they sent off a very important Indian of Tipu (who later
was Cacique) with some others who were in his company, with orders to say to the
Canek that the Religious were there, and to hand over to him a present of the trifles
that had been given them in Merida for this purpose and also a little <i>Cacao</i> from
Tipu, which was very fine (and is so even today), and a very good <i>hanger</i> (cutlass).
They warned the messenger also to tell the Canek to send them good Canoes for them
to cross to his Island, and some of his Chief men who should take them thither.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Important Indian, Don Gaspar Cetza (for so he was named), set forth for the
Island with the others who were going with him. And when eight days had been spent
in waiting (which caused the Padres anxiety) Don Gaspar returned, accompanied by
the Captains Ahchatappol and Ahauppuc, who had been in the Village of Tipu, and
by other Itzaex Indians, as well as by four large Canoes which Canek sent in order
that all might cross over in one trip.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;With this good provision they embarked,
all feeling very contented and happy, on that same day after having said Mass and
eaten. And with the Itza Captains and the other Indians, they navigated, in good
time, the length of that Lake to the Island which, from that direction, is some
six leagues. The Itzaex, who were in sight in order to see when they were approaching
the Island, and others who in Canoes came out to a great distance for the same purpose,
gave notice to the Canek of how the Religious were already arriving and were approaching.
And the Canek sent a son-in-law of his with others of his Family, in two Canoes,
who came out more than two leagues to salute the Padres and receive them in his
name.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Arrive at Tayasal and are well Received</b>. &quot;They brought
them some of that Drink which is called <i>Zaca</i>, together with frothed <i>cacao</i>, which
is highly esteemed among them (and, in short, though they were Barbarians, they
did not fail to have their own sort of politeness in some matters and signs of urbanity
and good manners). They arrived at the Landing place very near the Village, and
there was the Petty King or Cacique Canek with his Chiefs and a great crowd who
had come out to receive them. And it was already about ten at night when they arrived
at the Island, but there were many lighted torches of <i>Oçote</i> or Candlewood: so
that all was clear and visible.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;When the Religious had set foot on Land, Canek
received them with demonstrations of great love and good will, and with much content.
He invited the Religious to a House which he had made for them, although it was
not very large, near his Palace, or rather, large House where he resided, and which
was some twenty paces from that of the Padres, which was ample for their necessities.
Two very good <i>Barbacoas</i> (=?) were set up, according to their usage as Beds, and
all those who were with the Padres were quartered nearby.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The House of Canek was
some forty paces from the Lake and before it was a small Square in which was the
House which he had had built for the Religious and with which they were much pleased,
seeing how near it was to his own and how easy it would be to communicate with him
frequently. Besides, the site was a very good one. And on the day after their arrival
they embellished a Room in their House and erected there an Altar so that they might
say Mass; and Padre Fuensalida chanted that of Saint Paul the Apostle, to whom they
gave the Patronage of that Island.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Mass is Said</b>. &quot;Very many of the Itzaex were looking on from
outside with profound silence and without making a single sound that could disturb
what the Religious were doing. They, after having said Mass, went to see Canek,
and after having saluted him, they remained in conversation with him a great while,
for they knew the Language very well. They asked his leave to go all through the
Village and to see its Houses and all its <i>Cues</i> or Temples, which were numerous.
Canek conceded it, and gave them important Indians who were to go with them through
the Village and show them all that they wished to see. The principal purpose of
the Padres in soliciting this permission was to make a beginning to their preaching;
from that time on, in the presence of Canek, of the Chiefs and of a great crowd
of <i>Zamaguales</i> or Common People, they began to preach the Law of God....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Fuensalida Preaches; Orbita Destroys an Idol</b>. &quot;With great attention
the Indians who were congregated there listened to the discourse of the Padre Fuensalida....&quot;
For a brief time it looked as if the Padres might attain success in the errand,
but as we saw in Chapter III, Padre Orbita, in anger, destroyed the idol of the
horse and also the tolerance of the Itzas.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Having returned to the guest house,
and having rested a little from the toil of the Spiritual Battle and of breaking
the Idol, the Religious went to see Canek, who, although he already knew what had
happened in the Temple, and though they themselves spoke of it to him, did not say
a word about it, nor did he show anger on account of it. So that the other Indians,
seeing their Lord calm, became entirely appeased, and spoke no more of the affair
to the Padres. But it is true that the Canek did not leave off wondering that they
should have dared to do such a thing as that.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Urge the Itzas to be Christians</b>. &quot;He made them sit
down on something which was like a small throne and on which he was wont to sit
himself; it was then raised and placed in the midst of them, and being thus raised,
the Padres discoursed for a long time concerning the affairs of God and the Holy
Catholic Faith....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>They Refuse because the Appointed Time has not Come</b>. They told
the Canek that a previous Canek had promised Cortes to receive Christianity. &quot;...
Canek replied: That the time had not yet arrived in which their ancient Priests
had prophesied to them they were to relinquish the worship of their Gods; because
the Period in which they then were was Oxahau, which means Third Period<a name="div2Ref_5.6" href="#div2_5.6"><sup>5.6</sup></a> ...
and so they asked the Padres to make no further attempts in that direction at that
time, but to return to the Village of Tipu and then, on another occasion, to come
again to see them.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Despite all this, Canek was the first to receive, with great
pleasure, a Cross which the Padres placed in his hands, and afterwards some of his
men received others. Canek gave the Padres permission, during the days they were
his guests, to chant the Christian Doctrine; they did so in the seventh Tone as
they were accustomed to chant it in the Province of Yucatan.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>After a Few Days the Padres Leave Tayasal</b>. &quot;In this way several
days passed, and the Religious, perceiving that they could in no wise proceed with
the execution of their good desire, on account of the fact that the Indians would
not change their minds, determined to return to the Village of Tipu in order to
obtain the benefit of the good-will of the people there with their suavity and patience.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They imparted this determination to the Infidels, who readily agreed to it. The
Indians who had come with them made ready a Canoe; and the Itzas gave the Religious
some figures of their Idols, which they took to Yucatan that they might be seen,
and some Clothing of the sort the Indians use.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The Padres left Tayasal under rather
unpleasant circumstances; some of the Indians seem to have harbored a grudge against
them because of the incident of the idol, and these malcontents hurled insults after
the canoes in which the Padres were going away. They returned to Tipu by the same
way they had come, arriving there at the beginning of November. The <i>Beneficiado</i>
of Bacalar would not let them stay in Tipu; he was reprimanded by the Bishop for
his surliness. Finally Padre Fuensalida returned to Merida, leaving Orbita In charge
of the Indians at Tipu.</p>
<p class="normal">Thus ended the entrada of Fuensalida and Orbita into the
country of the Itzas. One cannot but admire the stanch faith and unswerving loyalty
to their ideals of these two men. They were both of great personal courage and virtue,
but from the foregoing account of their entrada it is easy enough to deduce that
Fuensalida was the greater man of the two. Orbita was skillful in making effective
altar displays, but he was hasty and unwise in his treatment of the idol of the
horse. We must, however, frankly acknowledge that for two men to go alone and unarmed
into the midst of a powerful nation of barbarians whom they believed to be cannibals
was a deed of very great bravery, especially as they had no expectations of personal
material gain. This entrada of 1618 is just barely mentioned by Fray Andrés de Avendaño
y Loyola (30 recto), who, however, speaks of the idol incident as a mistake of policy.</p>

<h2><a name="div1Ref_6.0" href="#div1_6.0">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<h3>THE ENTRADA OF PADRE FRAY DIEGO DELGADO AND<br>
THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED, 1621-1624</h3>
<p class="continue"><b>Padre Fray Diego Delgado&#39;s Offer to Christianize the Itzas</b>. In
spite of the unfortunate turn that events had taken while Fuensalida and Orbita
were at Tayasal, another Franciscan, Fray Diego Delgado, was filled with a desire
to Christianize the Itzas. He set out from Merida; Villagutierre (lib. ii, cap.
8) relates the story thus:</p>
<p class="continue">&quot;... A year and a half, with a slight difference, after
the return of the Padres Orbita and Fuensalida, repulsed by the Itzaex, at a time
when already the year 1621 was running its course and the Provincial Chapter of
the Order of Saint Francis had already been held in the City of Merida, a proposal
was made by the Padre Fray Diego Delgado, of the same Order and a Son of the Province
of Los Angeles, to the new Provincial of Yucatan, the proposal being dictated by
the desires of his Spiritual Love.&quot;</p>
<p class="continue">There follows a setting forth of Delgado&#39;s belief
that the fugitive Indians were likely to relapse into idolatry. Delgado asked leave
to go and reconvert them; this was given by Arias Conde, Governor <i>ad interim</i> of
Yucatan. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delgado Travels to the Convent of Xecchacan</b>. &quot;Everything having
been made ready for his journey, the Monk journeyed to that Convent of his Order
which is in the Village of Xecchacan. And when his intention was known there, several
Indians of the Village offered to go with him, for those of that place are well-versed
in the Woodlands. And also certain other Indians who were Singers and Sacristans
of the Convent, as is customary ..., also promised to go with him.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>He is well Provided with Guides and Other Indians</b>. &quot;So that
now Fray Diego Delgado found himself not only with Guides, but with those who would
aid him in celebrating the Divine Services and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. And
also some of the Indians of the Sierra came to him with a great inclination and
desire to accompany him on that Voyage. And together with These and Those, he entered
into the Woodlands to the Southward of that Land of Yucatan.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And as soon as he
began to penetrate the Woods, he kept encountering many of the Indians who were
fugitives from the Villages of the Province, and who were living without Decency,
Towns or Sacraments, but merely in Huts in several places of that Wilderness.&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Zaclun</b>. &quot;He went about, bringing them with flattering caresses
and the great suavity of his holy and loving words, and bearing them to the Mountains
which are called the Mountains of Pimienta (which are very near the Sierra of Alabaster)....
He formed with them a great Village on the same site as where had been before the
village called Zaclun, which had been depopulated when the Guardians of the Province
of San Francisco, who had gone, in former times, toward those inland Mountain Places,
had been lost.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;He gave the Village the Name of San Felipe or Santiago de Zaclun.
And in virtue of the Power given him by the Governor of Yucatan, to appoint Justices
and Rulers in whatever Villages might be founded, he did this in the new Village
of Zaclun in the Name of his Majesty and of his Governor of the Provinces of Yucatan,
giving the posts to the most fit of those very Indians he had recently assembled.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;He appointed a Cacique and gave Authority to Alcaldes, Regidores, and other Officials
of Government and of Public Weal, all of whom he appointed in order that those Indians
might live in Justice, Christianity, and service to God and the King. And when this
was done he gave an account of the whole matter to the Governor of Yucatan, begging
him to confirm the Elections and Appointments that he had made for that new Village.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Governor of those Provinces of Yucatan at the time was Don Diego de Cárdenas,
who celebrated with very great merriment the reception of such news, a delight which
was participated in by all the Dwellers in the City of Merida and even in the rest
of that Land and Province of Yucatan.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Captain Francisco de Mirones, who was Juez
de la Grana [agrarian officer] of the Territory of the Coast of Yucatan, and a very
great Soldier, and the gallantry of whose Spirit was delighted at this new turn
of affairs, conjectured that it was a fine occasion to enter by that Village of
Zaclun to conquer by Arms the Itzaex; for the Religious, with all their preaching,
had made no headway. Captain Mirones was persuaded that by way of Zaclun the Conquest
would be easier, on account of the convenience which the nearness of that place
would offer for whatever military operation he might wish to carry out.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Proposal of Mirones</b>. &quot;He went to communicate this Proposal
to the Governor, adorning the plan with arguments as to its suitableness, which
he well knew how to do; to the Governor it appeared a very good thing that that
Entrada into the Itzaex should be executed even as Captain Mirones proposed.&quot;
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Mirones and the Governor Make an Agreement</b>. There follows a
passage relating to the agreement made between the Governor and Mirones. It is in
no way unusual. The remissness of Brizeño at the time of the entrada of Orbita and
Fuensalida is touched upon, and the usual protestations as to the desirability of
converting the Indians to Christianity. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Mirones Raises an Army for his Entrada</b>. &quot;Captain Francisco
de Mirones raised his Banner for the King, and having enlisted as many as Five hundred
Spanish Soldiers, he set forth with them and with some Indians of War and of Service
from the City of Merida to join the rest who were being recruited at the Village
of Oxcutzcab in the Sierra. The journey through that region led the Guide to tell
Captain Mirones that from Oxcutzcab he had surveyed the highlands of the Itzas of
Yucatan, that in a direct line or through the Air it was a distance of only eighty
leagues, so that more than a half of the Road had already been traversed; having
believed it all to be so, Captain Mirones ... set forth with his Troops, and many
Indian laborers, from the Village of Oxcutzcab, opening many Roads through the Woods
and Thickets and among the Lakes and Swamps and sterile Lands, lacking water in
many places. So that not only for the Indians who opened the roads, but also for
the Spanish Soldiers, it was very painful work.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Mirones Arrives at Zaclun</b>. &quot;But at last, these difficulties
being overcome, they arrived at the Village of Zaclun, where the Padre Fray Diego
Delgado was established, administering to his Indians recently collected. In the
Village Captain Mirones made a halt, making a Plaza de Armas so as to wait for the
rest of his Troops, who were still being levied in Merida, in order that, on their
arrival, he might begin with all his forces the Conquest of the Itzas.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Wanton and Foolish Oppression Caused by Mirones</b>. &quot;The Recruiting
of Troops in Merida could not be concluded in the short space of time expected by
Captain Mirones, and so all the remainder of that year of 1622 was spent thus in
the Village of Zaclun waiting for the Levies. And at that time, failing in wisdom
and lacking proper consideration of the fact that those Indians of Zaclun were people
newly reduced and that it would not be fitting to treat them with the sort of oppression
with which it is sometimes customary to treat others in those parts of America,
that Captain gave himself up to trades and unduly profitable contracts with them,
which did not please them. So they began to be exasperated and to show some asperity
of temper.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Padre Fray Diego, recognizing the harm, and perceiving that it was not
a good way to maintain his hold over the Indians or to keep the Indians on the right
path, asked the Captain not to persist in those trades and contracts with the Indians,
for the time of Conquests was not the time for merchandizing. He pointed out to
him what he already knew, that the Indians were getting very much put out, and that
grave obstacles to the carrying on of what had been begun might arise, and that
it was not without cause that our Kings had ordered in so many Laws and Ordinances,
the good treatment of the Indians.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delgado Opposes Mirones</b>. &quot;The Padre, by these representations,
was unable to procure any change in the Captain, but each day increased the latter&#39;s
profits and extortions, so that the Indians of that Village became increasingly
restless.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The quarrels which the Captain and the Padre came to have over these
questions were now declared in public and even talked of to a certain extent, and
both were displeased with the other, and the Indians were uneasy and half mutinous.
And the disquiet of these latter was increased by the arrival at that Village of Zaclun of news that Captain Juan Bernardo de Casanova was now in the Village of
Mani on his march with fifty Soldiers who had been recruited in Merida to join in
the Village of Zaclun with Captain Mirones and those whom he had with him. All of
which gave cause to the unfortunate events which I shall now describe.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Villagutierre
(lib. ii, cap. 9) has an account of how Fray Diego complained to his Provincial
of Captain Mirones and his actions. The Provincial, urging the illegality of Mirones&#39;
projected entrada to the Itzas, and especially that of his intention to conquer
them by arms, advised Fray Diego to depend for advice as to the course he should
pursue solely upon heavenly inspiration. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delgado Determines to Anticipate Mirones</b>. &quot;When Padre Fray
Diego received this Reply, he determined (although with great secrecy) to leave
Captain Mirones and to go himself to the Itzaex. And so he did, nor did he lack
the company of most of the Indians who had come with him from Xecchacan. He undertook
his journey, directing his steps toward Tipu; and although there were many trials
and hardships on account of the Woods and rough country entirely without Roads,
Villages and rest from fatigue, his Indians bore him thither.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Being suspicious,
and knowing the Road that the Padre had taken, Captain Mirones dispatched twelve
Soldiers after him with their Leader, who was the Standard-bearer Acosta, in order
that they might catch up with him and persuade him to return to the Captain&#39;s company,
and, in case the Padre did not wish so to return, they were to follow after him
and escort him wherever he might go.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Squad came up with the Religious just
before he reached Tipu. But the more they insisted that he return to Zaclun, the
more impossible did it become to convince him and to make him return, so they accompanied
him, forming an escort for him, as far as the Village of Tipu, which they entered
with him and with the Indians who were with him.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Chief of the Soldiers dispatched
a report from Tipu to Captain Mirones of the invincible resolution in which Padre
Fray Diego persisted, because the Soldiers had orders not to desert the Padre. There
is but little doubt what the feelings of the Infidel Indians would be, wherever
he passed with those Soldiers, and that so long as he was accompanied by them, the
Indians would not dare to maltreat him.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delgado&#39;s Message to Canek</b>. &quot;Padre Fray Diego Delgado determined
to send to the Itzaex and to their King Canek to say that he was in the Village
of Tipu, and that with their Permission, he would come to see them. An offer to
bear this Message was made by the good Cacique Don Christoval Na, who had gone with
the Padres Orbita and Fuensalida to the Itzaex both times, as has been seen. In
effect, he went to Chaltuna; crossed to the Island; delivered his Message. And when
the Itzaex and their King and Lord Canek were informed of the small number of Spaniards
who were with Padre Fray Diego in Tipu, Canek and his Chiefs gave Permission and
Safe-conduct to the Padre so that he might come to the Island.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delgado Receives Permission from Canek to Come to Tayasal</b>.
&quot;And when the Cacique Don Christoval had returned with this Reply, and when the
provisions had been made ready as usual and when all the other things necessary
for the Journey had been prepared [the Padre set out] taking with him the Spaniards
and eighty Indians from his Village to carry the supplies and baggage of the Spaniards.
All went by the accustomed Road. And so they were spied upon by the Itzaex, who
were on the lookout and who sent to the landing-place some very good Canoes so that
they might cross to the Island.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Treachery of the Itzas</b>. &quot;Padre Fray Diego, the Cacique
of Tipu, and alt the other Spaniards and Indians embarked. On landing on the Island
the Itzaex received them in Peace and without any sign whatever of contrary feelings.
But all this was pretence and evil deceitfulness and perfidy, because as soon as
they had them in their power, all the Troops of the Village attacked the unprepared
Spanish Soldiers; the Indians from Tipu were unable to defend themselves: the Itzaex
manacled them all and even the Padre Fray Diego himself.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Delgado and Others are Put to Death</b>. Villagutierre tells in
detail how the soldiers must have been armed, because they would not be so foolish
as to trust to the honor of natives; they were, however, but thirteen in number.
All the soldiers were killed, and their hearts were torn from their breasts, while
their heads were set up on stakes around the village. Later they took Fray Diego,
cut him up into pieces, and set his head on a stake also. The fate of Cacique Na,
whom, no doubt, the Itzas regarded as a traitor to his own race, was no better.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Mirones Sends Ek after Delgado</b>. Meanwhile Mirones had received
no word from the men he had sent as an escort to Padre Diego Delgado. He sent two
Spaniards from Zaclun with an Indian servant of his who was very cunning and who
was to act as an interpreter and guide. His name was Bernardino Ek. These three
were to go to Tipu and learn all that they could of the whereabouts of the Padre
and the soldiers. On their arrival at that village they were told that Delgado and
the rest had gone to the Itzas. The three determined to follow; they did so, and
directly they had reached the lake, canoes came in response to a smoke signal and
bore them to the island, where they were all shut up in a corral and kept under
guard. They made an attempt to escape, Ek leading the way. He succeeded in getting
out on the lake in a very bad canoe which he found on the beach, but the two Spaniards
found themselves greatly hampered by their bonds and were recaptured. Ek hid in
the woods from those who were pursuing him and eventually made his way to Salamanca,
where he told all that had happened. A report was sent to Governor Don Diego de
Cárdenas in Merida, and Ek himself was sent to Captain Mirones at Zaclun. The latter
straightway entered a complaint against Fray Diego for having done anything so foolhardy
as to go to the Itzas. The upshot of the report made by Mirones&#39; agent, Juan de
Eguiluz, was that the Provincial of the Order of San Francisco in Yucatan sent to
Zaclun one Padre Fray Juan de Berrio, a native of Castile. Villagutierre continues
(lib. ii, cap. 10): &quot;He, having been there [at Zaclun] a matter of fifteen days,
because he did not well agree with the affairs and actions of the Captain and the
Soldiers, returned to Merida without saying anything to them, and he went to the
presence of his Provincial, who, being informed of all that was going on, considered
his retreat to that City [Merida] a deed well done.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;A second time Captain Mirones
made complaint through Contador Eguiluz, and he asked, as he did the first time,
for another Friar. The Provincial refused to give him one because of what had occurred
with the other two whom he had sent before....&quot; As a result of these wranglings
two Creole monks were finally sent to Zaclun. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Revolt of the Indians</b>. After they had been ordered to go to
Zaclun, they proffered various excuses, and the matter was ended at last by one
Padre Fray Juan Enriquez, who offered to go thither himself. He was well received
by Mirones; at about that time Bernardino Ek arrived with the news of the death
of Delgado and his companions. Mirones would not believe him. He soon had ample
cause to do so. On the Day of Purification, 1624, when all the Spaniards of Zaclun
were at Mass, the Indians rose in revolt and put most of them to death.</p>
<p class="normal">Some time
later Padre Fray Juan Fernandez and Captain Juan Bernardo came to Zaclun by way
of Mani. The latter joined him at Mani, and as both were made suspicious by some
Indians leading a mule of which they could not give a satisfactory account, Fernandez
and Bernardo determined to go to Zaclun. When they reached that place they found
the bodies of their compatriots, who had died &quot;by the very arms with which they
had thought to go against the Itzaex, in opposition to the orders and will of the
King.&quot; (Villagutierre, p. 144.) A Christian burial was given to the dead, after
which Fernandez and Bernardo returned to Merida to report on what they had found.
Eventually an Indian captain named Don Fernando Camal captured many of the aggressors,
the chief of whom, Ahkimpol, with several others, was beheaded in Merida. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>An Epidemic of Apostasy; the Third Phase of the Conquest of
the Itzas Begins</b>. A direct result of this insurrection was a general epidemic of
apostasy which especially affected such villages as Tipu. There, a few years later,
a general exodus of the Indians into the mountains and woods took place, and a widespread
relapse into idolatry occurred.</p>
<p class="normal">By a cedula of March 29, 1639, the King (Philip
III) reiterated his desire that henceforth all efforts to reduce provinces should
be carried on by means of spiritual methods only. These were not enough. A series
of misfortunes and mutinies occurred at Bolonchen, Zahcabchen, Petenecte, and elsewhere.
(Villagutierre, p. 147.)<a name="div2Ref_6.1" href="#div2_6.1"><sup>6.1</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal">We have now, with the year 1624, reached the close
of the second phase of the Spanish conquest of the Maya-Itza stock. The first phase,
an exploratory one, began with Cortes in 1524 and ended with Montejo in 1545 or
thereabouts. The second phase, a proselytizing one, began with the year 1614, when
the feigned submission of the Itzas took place, giving rise to the entrada of Fuensalida
and Orbita. It came to a dose about 1624 as a result of the mournful events following
upon the entrada of Delgado and the mercenary meddling of Mirones. The third and
last phase, a commercial and military one, we shall consider in Chapter VIII. It
had its inception about 1692.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="div1Ref_7.0" href="#div1_7.0">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
<h3>THE EARLY HISTORY OF GUATEMALA AND THE<br>
ENTRADA FROM THAT COUNTRY, 1694-1695</h3>
<p class="continue">Hitherto all our attention has been absorbed by the Maya-speaking
peoples of Yucatan and northern Guatemala and with the entradas made from Yucatan
into the Peten region and to Tayasal. Now, however, we are to consider, first, the
early history of the Maya-speaking peoples of southern Guatemala and the entradas
made from that region into the northern parts of the country in search of Lake Peten
and Tayasal. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Indian Tribes of Guatemala</b>. The two chief tribes were the
highly cultured Cakchiquel and Quiché. They lived in what may be described as the
central portion of modern Guatemala. To the north of them dwelt the Choles, Lacandones,
Mopanes, and Itzas; to the south, along the Pacific coast, were the Pipiles. With
the exception of the latter, all these people spoke dialects of Maya. It is well
to note, however, that both Fuentes y Guzman (1882) and Stoll (1884) arrived at
the conclusion that at least two thousand years must have elapsed to permit of the
development of the differences that exist between the Maya of Yucatan and the Maya
of the Cakchiquel and of the Quiché. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Account of the Cakchiquel and of the Quiché</b>. The migration
myths of the Cakchiquel and of the Quiché show that they came originally from the
region of Mexico. Much later the Pipiles, a Nahuatl tribe, formed trade colonies
on the Pacific coast. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Government and the Cities of the Cakchiquel and of the
Quiché</b>. The ruler was chosen alternately from two families, the Zotzil and the Xahil.
In like manner the early Colombian chiefs of Tunja and of Muequeta alternately chose
from among their relatives the chief of Suamo. The title of the ruler was Ahpo-Zotzil
or Ahpo-Xahil, as the case might be. The word <i>ahpo</i>, like the Quichua word <i>apu</i>,
which it resembles, means &quot;Great Chief.&quot; There was a marked division into classes
among the Cakchiquel and the Quiché. In addition the sacerdotal body was strongly
intrenched in the social system. The Annals of the Cakchiquel (Brinton, 1885) throw
some light on the history of these people. These Annals were written by a member
of the Xahil family. The mythical accounts go back to the reign of King Gagavitz,
who flourished about 1380. Sometime early in the fifteenth century the Cakchiquel
came into violent contact with the Quiché, and Quikab, King of the Quiché, made
good, for a time, his rule over the Cakchiquel. Later the latter regained their
freedom and founded Iximché. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Spanish Conquest</b>. What Cortes was to Mexico and Montejo was
to Yucatan, Pedro de Albarado or Alvarado was to Guatemala. He was sent to that
country by Cortes, with whom he had been in Mexico. Leaving Mexico on November 13,
1523, he went to Guatemala with about eighty adventurous followers, an abundance
of munitions, and some ships. He reduced the whole region of the Cakchiquel-Quiché
peoples to a Spanish province. (Cortes, apud MacNutt, 1908, vol. ii, p. 178; Fuentes
y Guzman, 1882, vol. i, p. 46.) On July 25, 1524, the official title of this city
became Santiago de los Cavalleros de Goathemala. In 1533 the King ordered Alvarado,
whom he had made Governor of Guatemala, to make to him a full report concerning
the country and its people and their customs. In 1541 Alvarado died at Guatemala,
having in the meantime been to Peru. From that time down to about 1675 the city
and Audiencia of Guatemala enjoyed a fair measure of prosperity under the usual
type of Spanish rule. In 1675 some Chol Indians arrived there, asking the Dominican
Provincial of Guatemala, Padre Maestro Fray Francisco Gallegos, for missionaries
to teach them the Christian faith. (Villagutierre, p. 150 ff.) </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Gallegos and Delgado</b>. As a result of this Gallegos himself
and Padre Fray Joseph Delgado set off from Guatemala and traveled twenty-three leagues
through very rough country. At length they came upon some Choles, whom they formed
into three small villages called San Lucas, Nuestra Señora del Rosario, and Santiago.
They later made these villages one and placed in it the thirty or so Indians whom
they had baptized. As the other Indians had withdrawn further to the north, the
Provincial and Delgado determined to go after them. The Indian converts objected
to this, but the missionaries overcame their fears. In due time they came to a certain
hill which the natives worshiped as God of the Mountains. Some Indian lads they
had with them as servants urged the Padres to place an offering of copal before
this god in order to propitiate him and prevent him from destroying them all. Of
course the two priests refused to give in to the superstitious fears of their servants.
They said Mass instead. As a result all their followers, save two bearers, left
them. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Indians are Friendly to them</b>. Once the mountains had been
safely crossed, the Padres found that the Indians on the other side came to see
them readily enough. When the natives found that their white visitors meant them
no harm, they welcomed them and made a comfortable pathway, over which they conducted
the Padres. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Route Taken by the Two Padres</b>. After some time they reached
the shore of a large, fine river called Yaxha. There they encamped for a while,
going on afterward to the house of a cacique named Matzin, who was later christened
Martin. He treated them very well and they founded the village of San Jacinto Matzin
and preached the Christian faith there. Four leagues away lived another cacique,
called Ilixil, to whom, in spite of the risk of hunger, they went. First founding
a village called San Pedro y San Pablo Ilixil, the Padres baptized many children.
In that same village of Ilixil they met some Indians who had come thither from Cahabon
and who offered to act as guides. With them the Padres went to a place called May.
After several interesting adventures, told by Villagutierre (p. 157), they renamed
the village San Joseph May.</p>
<p class="normal">The rainy season shortly afterward began, and the missionaries
retired toward Cahabon, setting up crosses as landmarks at suitable places along
the way. When they regained their first village, San Lucas Tzalac, they found matters
much as they had left them. From San Lucas they went to Cahabon, and from there
to Cohan, in search of some Indians called Axoyes, of whom they had heard. In response
to a call issued from Coban by Gallegos, one hundred and eighty persons came to
him. They had already been baptized and wanted only to confess. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Several Villages Founded</b>. On this trip Padres Gallegos and
Delgado baptized twenty-three hundred and forty-six persons and founded many villages:
San Lucas Tzalac, Nuestra Señora del Rosario, San Jacinto Matzin, San Pedro and
San Pablo Ilixil, Assumpcion, San Joseph May, San Miguel Manche, San Francisco Sacomo
(= Secouamo on Hendges 1902?), and San Fernando Axoy. Villagutierre (p. 161) gives
a long list of the places to which the Padres did not go. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Dominicans and the Franciscans</b>. We have already seen that
most of the curacies in Yucatan were in the hands of friars of the Franciscan Order.
In Guatemala, on the other hand, there was for a long time a dispute between the
Dominicans and the Franciscans as to which should have the privilege of proselytizing
in Guatemala. This quarrel, which Remesal (p. 587 ff.) plainly thought disgraceful,
was at its height from 1551 to 1560. On January 22, 1556, cedulas were dispatched
from Valladolid bidding both the orders to live at peace with each other. Both orders
had fine churches in Guatemala. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Struggles between the Dominicans and the Indians</b>. We have already
noticed how, as early as 1533, the King had expressed a wish to know everything
possible about the dwellers in Guatemala. In 1555 the Lacandones and Puchutla put
to death the good Dominican missionary. Fray Domingo de Vico. From that time there
was a constantly growing wish on the part of the Spaniards to conquer those people,
not only because they were not Christians and ate human flesh, but because they
were a constant menace. On January 22, 1556, a cedula was dispatched ordering that
the trouble-makers be reduced to obedience. (Remesal, lib. x, cap. 11.) For a long
time after that bitter struggles between the Dominicans and the Indians lasted,
struggles which caused the Spaniards to give the name of Tierra de Guerra to the
region. One of the missionaries in this region. Fray Diego de Ribas, had some success
in the region north of Huehuetenango in 1685. (Villagutierre, p. 176 ff.) He and
his men opened up a road that led from Huehuetenango into the regions north and
east of there. They got on very well until they came into contact with some Lacandones,
who proved to be spies. From that time on their troubles increased.</p>
<p class="normal">From all this
it is easy to deduce that the peoples to the south of the Lacandones and Maya (such
people as the Choles) were of a comparatively docile temperament and were easily
won over, temporarily, to the Christian faith. As soon, however, as the fiercer
and more stubborn Lacandones brought their influence to bear upon the converts,
the latter found that their attachment to the new religion was but superficial.
(Remesal, lib. x, cap. 10.) Moreover, the lack of authority to use armed force wherever
necessary was another disadvantage under which the missionaries labored. There can
be but little doubt that they also were too hasty in their attempts to exchange
the somewhat abstruse spiritual worship of the Catholic Church for the veneration
of tangible gods of stone or wood. They were quick to destroy the old and long-venerated
gods, but they were unable to replace them with something the Indians were able
to understand.</p>
<p class="normal">In 1686 the King (Charles II), calling the Viceroy&#39;s attention to
the great number of unconverted tribes in Guatemala, Yucatan, and elsewhere, ordered
further reductions to be made, at once, but as gently as possible. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Inception of the Plan to Subdue the Itzas, 1689</b>. In 1689
Captain Juan de Mendoza wrote to the court to tell how the reductions had been begun,
and to ask that he might be placed at the head of fifty soldiers. On the advice
of Guzman, who had now returned from Guatemala to the Spanish court, his wish was
granted. The following plan for the reduction of the Choles and the Lacandones was
decided upon. (Villagutierre, p. 190.)</p>
<p class="normal">Three entradas were to be made at the same
time. One from the province of Guatemala, which was in the hands of the Dominicans;
a second from Huehuetenango, which was Mercedarian; and the third from Chiapas,
which was Dominican. Fray Augustin Cano, of the Order of Predicadores, and Fray
Diego de Ribas, of the Order of la Merced, were to go first and try, by peaceful
means, to accomplish their purpose. Mendoza was to try more vigorous measures. Juan
de Mendoza and his men were to be nothing more than an escort to the Padres, and
the conquest was to be accomplished only by the evangelical word. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Soberanis Ordered to Coöperate</b>. On November 24, 1692, like
orders were given to Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno, Governor of Yucatan, and
he was told to coöperate with President Barrios Leal of Guatemala. Unfortunately
the enterprise was interrupted by the fact that unjust accusations caused a suspension
of Leal&#39;s powers from 1691 to 1694. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Ursua to Succeed Soberanis in Office</b>. At about this time an
arrangement was made by the King whereby the Sargento Mayor Don Martin de Ursua
y Arizmendi<a name="div2Ref_7.1" href="#div2_7.1"><sup>7.1</sup></a> was to succeed Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno in the government
of Yucatan. At the time Ursua was in Mexico, at the court of the Viceroy. Ursua,
who is to occupy much of our attention for some time to come, wrote a letter to
King Charles, which is given by Villagutierre (lib. iii, cap. 8) and which I here
translate in part. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>A Letter from Ursua y Arizmendi to the King of the Spains</b>.
&quot;<span class="sc">Sire</span>,--Your Majesty having had the graciousness to confer upon me the future possession
of the Governorship of the Provinces of Yucatan, in which post I am to succeed Don
Roque de Soberanis y Centeno, ... my employment, during the time of my Governorship,
is to be the Conversion and Reduction of the innumerable Indians, as well Infidel
as Apostate, who are between the said Provinces of Yucatan and those of Guatimala.
(And I shall urge) the opening of a road from the one to the other, not only to
facilitate Commerce, which would be for the Public Convenience and the service of
your Majesty, but would also make for the Reduction of the so many Indians.... So
I propose to Your Majesty: That at my own expense, and with no cost to the Royal
Exchequer, when I shall have entered upon the Governorship and shall have made my
Preparations, I shall put into execution the opening of a Highway from the Provinces
of Yucatan to those of Guatimala, at the same time reducing, by the peaceful means
of the Evangelical Preaching, all the Indians who shall be found in those regions.
But the Conversion is not to interrupt the opening of the Road which is more important
as it will facilitate the later reduction of all those who live in those parts by
the continuous Passing and Commerce of the Spaniards of both Provinces....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The King Grants all that Ursua Asks</b>. In the memorial just mentioned
Ursua asked that orders be given so that the prelates of the Order of San Francisco,
the President of the Audience of Guatemala, and the Viceroy of New Spain should
be obliged to give him every sort of aid needed.</p>
<p class="normal">In 1693 the King replied, saying
that he had given the desired orders to the Viceroy of New Spain, the President
of Guatemala, the Bishop of Yucatan, and the Provincial of San Francisco. He then
commanded that care should be taken to choose the best places for bridges, that
inns should be established every four or eight leagues for the shelter of travelers,
and that every effort should be made to form settlements that would insure the safety
of travelers. As the work was not to begin until Ursua had entered upon his duties
as Governor, the Viceroy, Conde de Galve, the Bishop, and others were unable, till
well into 1694, to aid the work they all wished to see brought to a successful conclusion.
Meanwhile Barrios Leal was still under the stigma of a Visita or Inspection. When
his character was cleared of all blame, in the middle of 1694, he was told how the
Itzas of Tayasal and other infidel nations were infesting the country and committing
various atrocities. Once Barrios Leal was restored, the reduction began in earnest.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>President Barrios Aids in the Undertaking</b>. As soon as Barrios
Leal was restored to office as President of the Audience of Guatemala and as soon
as circumstances permitted, active preparations for the long-discussed conquest
of the Itzas were begun.</p>
<p class="normal">Villagutierre (lib. iv, cap. i) speaks thus of the preparations
that were made: &quot;We have already seen how intently President Don Jacinto de Barrios
considered the hints which the Missionary Padres Fray Melchor Lopez and Fray Antonio
Margil<a name="div2Ref_7.2" href="#div2_7.2"><sup>7.2</sup></a> and other persons had made to him, urging the importance of setting
about with all possible efficiency the reduction of Barbarism in those Woodlands.
So he promptly began to take the steps which seemed suitable in the matter.... It
was resolved by all the leaders and ministers: That the Entrada for the reduction
of the Woodlands should be made at the beginning of the next year, 1695 (which is
the beginning of summer in those lands)....&quot; </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Arrangements for the Entrada; Supplies, etc</b>. Provisions were
made whereby men who voluntarily gave aid in money or in extra services to those
who were directing the entrada were to be advanced in rank over their fellows. Besides
it was arranged that as soon as possible the religious authorities were to give
their necessary aid.</p>
<p class="normal">Juan de Mendoza had already been named leader of the army,
and as he was absent from the province at the time, it was decided that the President
should appoint as leaders those whom he thought best.</p>
<p class="normal">Villagutierre (p. 219) continues:
&quot;And the President was to call to the Junta de Guerra the Padres Maestros Fray Diego
de Ribas, Fray Augustin Cano, Fray Joseph Delgado, Fray Tomas Guerrero, and Fray
Pedro Monzón, as well as other persons well versed in the frontiers, Entradas and
Woodlands of the Infidels, because of the great value of their opinions in determining
the methods of operation and the manner of penetrating the forest region....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Likewise,
it was determined that the expenses they were planning to incur and which were found
necessary, should be met from the Royal Funds and that the Royal Officers should
issue orders for quantities of maize, beans, chili, and fowl, which were to be collected
with all speed as part of the Royal Tribute from the Provinces of Vera Paz, Chiapa,
and Gueguetanango.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And it was ordered that Spanish men-at-arms should be recruited
at once, and that notice of this determination should be given to the Alcaldes Mayores
and to Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno, Governor of the Province of Yucatan.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;At
this time the President had all the chief citizens of the City of Guatemala called
together.... He urged each one to aid with his person or with whatever aid of his
he could....&quot; The result of this appeal was a quickened activity in the recruiting
and in the collecting of supplies and munitions of war. At the same time Don Joseph
de Escals was applied to for aid in the collecting of donations or voluntary gifts.
</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Voluntary Contributions</b>. Toward the end of 1694 the donations
began to come pouring in. A list of them will give some idea of the scale on which
operations were carried out.</p>

<p class="hang2">Don Joseph de Escals sent from Sonsonate 350 pesos,
which he got by selling 56 horses given by the citizens.</p>
<p class="hang2">Don Juan Jeronimo de Mexia,
Corregidor of Huehuetenango, 100 pesos from the citizens and 100 of his own as well
as 14 horses.</p>
<p class="hang2">Quasaltenango, 14 horses but no money.</p>
<p class="hang2">Acasaguastlan, through Captain
Don Miguel de Azanon, its Corregidor, 34 horses but no money.</p>
<p class="hang2">Chiquimula, 70 horses
and 50 pesos.</p>
<p class="hang2">Soconusco, 30 horses and 6 mules.</p>
<p class="hang2">Esquintepeque and Guazacapan, 13
horses, 2 mules, and 23 pesos.</p>
<p class="hang2">San Salvador, 60 horses, 11 mules, and 200 pesos.</p>
<p class="hang2">Teconicapa and Huehuetenango, 33 horses, 800 fowl, and 400 bushels of maize.</p>
<p class="hang2">Guatemala,
1176 pesos, 49 horses, and 7 mules.</p>
<p class="hang2">Don Jacobo Barba of Zuchitepeque, 100 pesos.</p>
<p class="hang2">Don Francisco Lopez de Albizuri, two soldiers and paid for the entire time of the
campaign.</p>
<p class="hang2">Don Juan de Galvez, 20 horses.</p>
<p class="hang2">Don Estevan de Medrano, four soldiers for
six months.</p>
<p class="hang2">The totals of the donations were 2399 pesos, 354 horses, 22 mules, 420
bushels of maize, 800 fowl, etc. </p>

<p class="normal"><b>Quarrels between Soberanis and the Bishop of Yucatan</b>. While
matters were going forward in a fairly satisfactory manner in Guatemala, affairs
were quite unsatisfactory in Yucatan, where the quarrels between Don Roque de Soberanis
and the Bishop of Yucatan retarded all preparations.</p>

<p class="normal">At length the Viceroy of Mexico
despatched Don Francisco Sarasa as Oidor to look into the situation and to report
on it. As a result of his investigations Soberanis was deprived of his office. Believing
that he could best defend himself by going in person to Mexico, Soberanis left Yucatan
for the viceregal court. The natural step for the Viceroy, Conde de Galve, was to
appoint Martin de Ursua y Arizmendi as Governor <i>ad interim</i> and this was done.</p>
<p class="normal">Finding himself in possession (albeit only temporarily) of the government of Yucatan,
and in view of the fact that he already held the necessary orders and cedulas for
the opening of the road to Guatemala and for the conversion of the Indians along
the route, as well as the advices from the President of Guatemala speaking of the
matter, Ursua decided it was best to put them into immediate execution.</p>
<p class="normal">The year
1695 was already started and it was necessary to set to work at once, not only on
the actual work of the entrada, but also on the task of getting the good will of
the Cabildo of the city of Merida, of the Bishop, of the province of San Francisco,
and of the Count of Galve, Viceroy of New Spain. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>President Barrios Decides to Join the Entrada in Person</b>. Villagutierre
(lib. iv, cap. 4) goes on to inform us that after enough arms, munitions, food supplies,
and small gifts for the Indians were got together, and just as the troops and the
monks were on the point of setting off on their march to the woodlands. President
Barrios Leal made up his mind to go with them in person. Villagutierre (p. 228)
thus graphically describes the effect of his proposal: &quot;In spite of the fact that
the Ecclesiastical and Secular Cabildos of that City of Guatemala tried to dissuade
him from his plan, urging him to notice that although that undertaking was so glorious
and so much to the service of God and the King, and so greatly favored by all, by
the public welfare and by the good of Christendom, he ought not to risk his life
so wantonly upon it; and although they also warned him of the terribleness of the
attacks which were always suffered in the stomach because of the hardships of the
painful journey and country ride, bad resting-places, worse roads and lack of assistance,
rest and tranquillity, which would put his health in evident danger, so that all
felt he ought to give up, or at least postpone his journey until he was more hale
and hearty in health; in spite of all these and other objections nothing arose from
all these representations, and fears which sufficed to change the fervent zeal of
the bold President who, in replying, first thanked them all for the great attention
and affection with which they looked to his convenience, and then said that the
greatest safety lay only in his being the first in all dangers in the service of
Both Majesties.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The gallant old President (who appears to have been subject to
apoplectic seizures) wished to be in command of the army, but in case he were forced
to fall back at any time to a place of safety, he appointed an assistant, who was
Don Bartolomé de Amezquita, Fiscal of that Audience of Guatemala.</p>
<p class="normal">Amezquita, then,
was Captain General of the entrada, taking the Chiapas division. Captain Juan Diaz
de Velasco was made leader of the Vera Paz division. Don Tomás de Mendoza y Guzman
was made leader of the Huehuetenango division.</p>
<p class="normal">When the pay, supplies, and baggage
had been distributed among the soldiers, the President gave out his final orders
as to the length of a day&#39;s journey. He had already sent ahead to the Alcalde Mayor
of Ocozingo in Chiapas ordering that suitable <i>ranchos</i> be put up in certain places
to shelter the royal army when it should arrive. While the Indians of Ocozingo were
working on these they had been attacked by some Lacandon Indians when scarcely a
house had been completed. All these unmistakable evidences of the proximity of the
notorious Lacandones made Barrios choose the Chiapas division for himself, as it
was the most likely to come across them.</p>
<p class="normal">At the same time the President ordered
Don Tomás (de Mendoza?) de Guzman to go ahead with one hundred men and act as escort
for the Indians while they were putting up the houses near Ocozingo or any more
convenient place. Barrios had already informed Ursua that he intended to set out
in January, 1695, and the latter was to enter the unsubdued area from the north
at the same time. Surveyors were to go ahead of the main body of men, and by means
of smudges were to afford the greatest possible facility for the road openers, who
thus would be prevented from going astray. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Expedition Sets out from Guatemala City</b>. At length the
expedition really did start. (Villagutierre, pp. 234 ff.) Besides the soldiers and
Indian bearers there were many friars, among whom were Padre Fray Diego de Ribas,
Padre Fray Antonio Margil, Missionary Padre Fray Pedro de la Concepción, Master
Cano, and others. As the army set off, all the citizens and nobility of Guatemala
flocked to see them. The first day&#39;s journey led to Ixtapa, where they spent the
night; the next day they went to Pazon, then to Huehuetenango, which they entered
on January 23, 1695, having journeyed forty-six leagues from Guatemala.</p>
<p class="normal">In Huehuetenango
the President, the monks, the officers, and the men all met with a warm welcome
from the inhabitants. It is but natural that, on the eve of an undertaking which
must have appeared very formidable to them, a large part of the time should be given
up to religious exercises. Captain Melchor Rodriguez Mazariegos joined the party
at the head of fifty men. Mazariegos himself, together with the standard-bearer
Juan Salvador de Mata and Sergeant Pedro de Chaves Galindo, were all serving without
pay, and many other people from the region, as well as some from Tabasco, joined
the army voluntarily. </p>
<p class="normal"><b>Events at Huehuetenango</b>. On January 29, Amezquita arrived from
Guatemala, where he had been making some final arrangements. Barrios spent his time
at Huehuetenango in paying the new troops, distributing horses and supplies, and
making all the final arrangements.</p>
<p class="normal">It was not long before the news of the departure
of the President reached Ursua in Yucatan. (Villagutierre, pp. 235 ff.) The whole
enterprise was so important for the service of God, the King, the public weal, and
the souls of the Indians that Ursua immediately set about his preparations for the
share his government was to take in it.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Ursua&#39;s Activities</b>. Ursua did not follow the example of the
President by going in person at the head of his troops; instead he ordered Captain
Alonso Garcia de Paredes, Perpetual Regidor of San Francisco de Campeche and Captain
for War of the District of Sacabchen, to assemble what troops he could and to go
with them to meet the President, under whose orders he should place himself, reporting
to Ursua all occurrences of importance. For all this Ursua gave Paredes the title
of Aide or the Captain General of las Montañas. Francisco Gonzalez Richardo was
appointed subchief, second in command only to Ursua.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>An Army Sets out from Yucatan for the Montaña</b>. When all the
usual and needful preparations had been made, the army set out from Yucatan. As
soon as they left the settled part of the province they entered the territory of
the Quehaches, whom they put to flight after a sharp skirmish. Paredes&#39; soldiers,
however, refused to go on without reënforcements, so the expedition had to turn
back.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Padres Cano and Avendaño y Loyola</b>. We have already reviewed
the events up to 1695, in which year the two great divisions of the Spanish forces
set out to subdue the dangerous Itzas and Lacandones. Hereafter we will, in the
main, trust to two religious writers, whose accounts of the succeeding events are
very vivid. Maestro Fray Agustin Cano accompanied that division of the army which
was led by President Barrios; Padre Fray Andrés de Avendaño y Loyola, a Franciscan,
accompanied Ursua&#39;s division.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cano&#39;s Account of the Entrada from Guatemala</b>. For the sake
of continuity we will begin by quoting Cano&#39;s account of the entrada from Guatemala:
&quot;My Lord, Your Majesty having been pleased to appoint me in the Royal decree of
Nov. 24, 1692, to enter into the territories of the heathen, to try to bring about
their conquest, in the due obedience and execution of which, I personally took part
in the expeditions into those lands which they have made during these years through
the Province of Vera Paz, wishing to correspond to the Royal favor by which Your
Majesty has been pleased to appoint me for this purpose; I understand that it is
my duty to inform Your Majesty of what has happened in these expeditions, making
up for the delay of this report by the simple truth and clearness of the information
which up to the present time could not be given without a great deal of confusion
on account of the strange character of the events.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Route Followed by Cano</b>. &quot;The President [Barrios] ... finally
determined to enter by way of Chiapas, and that I should go by way of Vera Paz with
Captain Juan Diaz de Velasco and seventy men as an escort to the priests. Accordingly,
in the month of March, of the said year &#39;95, we started from the town of Cahabon,
which is the last town of Vera Paz; seven priests of my order, and we entered by
very rough paths into the highlands of the Chol, where we found many Indians, some
baptized, others heathen, and the more we penetrated those highlands, the more numerous
did we find the families in their hamlets, without the form of towns. We told all
these people that the object of our journey was to search for them so that they
should come together in towns in such a way that we should be able to come and live
with them in order to teach them the law of God and to administer the holy Sacraments
to them, and that we also wished that all the people of their tribe and of all the
other tribes in those highlands should know God, and should come together in towns.
Thus we went, passing from some farms to others in prosecution of our journey to
the Lake, and we left all the Indians peaceful and satisfied with the promise which
they made us to gather together in towns. In this we were obtaining plenty of good
results, since we taught them the Christian doctrine of which most of the baptized
Indians were totally ignorant. The children whom their fathers brought to us were
baptized, and the grown people confessed themselves, many who had relapsed were
consecrated anew, and the Holy Sacraments were administered to some Christian Indians
who were found dying in their houses.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;After passing through the Province of Chol,
which stretches from Cahabon forty-five or fifty leagues, we came upon another tribe
which is called the Mopanes, among whom Spaniards or ministers of the holy gospel
had never entered, and, although the difference in language was of some embarrassment,
God willed that we should find some Mopan Indians who understood the Chol language
and by means of these we declared to them the purpose of our journey. This had good
results at that time in the case of some adults, who, being dangerously ill, asked
for holy baptism, and in the case of some sick children whom their fathers brought
and who went to Heaven as the first-fruits among this tribe. Their principal cacique,
Taximchan, fled from us, and although we made various endeavors to draw him to us,
he always deceived us with false promises. But we made friends with four other caciques
of this tribe of the Mopanes Indians, called, in their paganism, the Cacique Zac,
the Cacique Tuzben, the Cacique Yahcab, and the Cacique Tezecum. They came to see
us with a part of their families, and every day there came many Mopanes Indians
to buy knives and many other little trifles which the soldiers sold in exchange
for blankets. We presented them with salt, and for this they came to see us and
to sell us their fruit, and apparently they were becoming friendly.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Chols and the Mopanes</b>. &quot;On account of the many Indians
who came every day to see us, and of the many farms and farm-buildings which we
saw in those highlands, we knew that that tribe of Mopanes was very numerous. They
all go naked like the Chols, and differ from them only in their hair, in that they
do not wear it of the same length like the Chols, but cut the hair on the front
part of the head and only wear it long behind. It is a race more robust and barbarous
than the Chols; they have idols of diabolical forms, some of which we found, and
they have many other superstitions, about which it would take long to tell. We found
very little frankness in their nature and we found that they have relations with
the Ahizaes Indians of the Lake; and we even learned that they all were of one Ytza
nation, calling themselves Mopan Ytza; Peten Ytza and these Mopanes were subject
to the petty King of the Lake, about which and about its Island of Peten and about
its caciques they gave us much information, although they always refused to show
us the way thither. Nevertheless, we prevailed upon the Cacique Zac to show us the
way from Mopan as far as the first plain, and from there forward our guide was the
Cacique Yahcab, who knew the Chol language, by means of which he served as an interpreter,
though a very unskilled one.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In this way we had some means of prosecuting our journey
to the Lake, and having written to the President by way of Vera Paz what had been
done, and leaving in Mopan two priests to take care of those Indians, with twenty
men for their protection, we priests, five in number, passed onward with Captain
Juan Diaz de Velasco and fifty men.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>From Mopan to the Lake</b>. &quot;We traveled from Mopan toward the
Lake a matter of thirty-two leagues, in which the confusion of our guide and interpreter,
the Cacique Yahcab, delayed us much more than our ignorance of the way; for he,
whether from his want of knowledge, or from malice, said at each stream or small
river that there was no more water till we reached the Lake. Having then come to
a small river called Chacal, we made a halt while some of our men crossed with the
guide and proceeded to reconnoiter the path, and they went forward in such a way
that they reached the Lake and discovered the great <i>Peten</i> or island which stands
in the middle of it, and which, according to the story of those who went there,
must be distant from Chacal a matter of fourteen or sixteen leagues. Our people
met many Ahizaes Indians, who came from the Lake to the shore armed with bows and
arrows, and they, at the first sight of our people, got their bows ready; but the
Indian Yahcab, who had been told what to do, calmed them by telling them that we
were traders, which the Ahizaes heard with much pleasure. But when the said interpreter
of ours went on to tell them that with these merchants were some Padres to teach
them the law of God, the Ahizaes raised a great whispering among themselves; and
as our people were unable to give the Ahizaes more reasons than those which that
rude interpreter had studied and offered, there was no way to pacify them, and it
was not known what they said, but all was confusion and disturbance, which resulted
in fighting and general encounters, in which our men received no damage, but of
the Ahizaes some were killed and wounded and two of them were captured; one of these
was called Quixan and the other Chan. These two Indians uniformly said that the
Ahizaes had taken up arms because they had had notice that we had come to Mopan,
and that they had not perceived any other people in their lands either in the direction
of Yucatan or in any other direction; which agreed with our not having any sign
either from the people who went with the said President Don Jacinto, nor of those
whom he had sent with the Padres de la Merced, although we made every effort to
find them. I wished that the said two Indians, or one of them, should go with a
message for his companions, but the affair was so stained with blood, and the time
was so advanced that it did not permit of these delays, and the Captain gave sufficient
reason for a contrary decision; and the Ahiza Indian called Chan quickly removed
any doubt by fleeing by night, as a result of which we took more care of the remaining
Indian called Quixan. Seeing, then, that at that time we were not able to get any
result in that Ahiza nation, as they had taken up arms and we, not understanding
their language, were not able to persuade them nor to come to an agreement with
them; so that, if we went on, it would only be to continue a war against the will
of our Majesty, as expressed in the Royal decree, and without any hope of good results,
since we were not able to enter into the Island for want of canoemen and of instruments
to make canoes, and for the same reason we could not go across the Lake in search
of the people of the said President.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Cano Advises Return</b>. &quot;Seeing also that the rains were beginning
with great fury, and that our people were becoming sick because of the change of
weather, to which was added our finding ourselves in such want of supplies that
we scarcely had what was needed to return to Mopan; for these reasons I advised
the Captain that we should return to Mopan, and that there we should await news
of the said President, and that when we had received this news we should see what
ought to be done. This plan we carried out, taking in our company the Ahiza Indian
called Quixan, treating him kindly and carefully.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Explanations of their Withdrawal Sent to Guatemala</b>. At this
juncture an unfortunate controversy sprang up. Cano says that he and his companions
wrote to Guatemala, explaining why they had withdrawn. Their explanations were not
accepted, however, because a false report had gained credence to the effect that
Don Jacinto Barrios had reached Lake Peten. The authorities in Guatemala persisted
in believing the latter report, and they charged the Padres with trying to discredit
the President. The General Assembly then issued a decree in which they ordered Captain
Velasco at once to return to the lake and fortify himself there on pain of losing
all his property like a traitor.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Decree of the General Assembly</b>. &quot;This was the substance
of the decree which was despatched to us, with many other circumstances in a line
with the ends and false bases on which the whole was founded.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;We received this
decree in Mopan, with many other letters of the same tenor, so that beside the ordinary
troubles (common to all), I had this one in addition to lay before our Lord....
Other letters [arrived] from the said President, D. Jacintho, written from a place
of the Lacandones, which we called Nuestra Señora de las Dolores, where he had joined
the people who had entered the country with the Padres de la Merced. In these letters
he replied to those which we had written when we entered Mopan, and he gave orders
in these that the men should retire, leaving thirty men as an escort in that place,
since the rainy season was beginning, and because he was doing the same thing on
his part; by this we knew that the second basis of the decree did not exist, since
the President found himself in Lacandon, which is so far away from the Lake of Ahiza....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Quarrels among the Soldiers and the Officials</b>. The entrada
from Guatemala came to a close to the accompaniment of incessant and petty wrangling
on the part of the soldiery and of the officials.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Writers of the Decree Punished</b>. It is good to know, however,
that the writers of the decree were punished by a sound reprimand. Cano was reinstated
in the respect of all. He tells the plans for future work in these words: &quot;... He
[President Barrios] intended going again the following year by the Province of Vera
Paz.... For this purpose I proposed to the said President that it was necessary
that those roads should be constructed in such a way that the supplies could be
carried in mule packs and not on the shoulders of Indians; and that the tools should
be provided for building canoes and boats,--also officers and seamen who should
know how to manage them, since in no other way was it possible to enter the Island
or <i>Peten</i> of Ahiza. All this was ordered to be provided and carried out; but it
was not carried out fully on account of the protracted and distressing illness of
the said President, which grew worse and worse every day. So that God permitted
that from this storm should result one calm death, and that, through antagonistic
means, there should be added new delays to this conversion.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Meanwhile there were
not wanting priests of good courage who wished to take part in the conversion of
these souls, and Fray Diego Palomino having died in the highlands of Chol from illness
which attacked him there, God moved the Reverend Reader, Fray Christobal de Prada,
with such powerful inclinations, that while he was giving a course in philosophy
in this convent of Guatemala with great credit and esteem, and without being detained
by the love of his scholars or the arguments of his friends, he gave up his chair
and went to the wilderness, where he devoted himself with so much fervor and zeal
to the education of those heathen that in a short time he perfected himself in the
language of Chol, of which he had already learned the rudiments; and he went ahead
of every one in the Mopan or Ahiza languages, without a master or grammar of the
said language, but only with what help he was able to get from the Mopan and Chol
Indians, of whom he brought together many who had fled before he went into the wilderness.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The outcome of the events described in this chapter resulted in the subjection of
the Itzas, but not, however, through the agency of the people of Guatemala. We shall
learn from the account of Fray Andrés de Avendaño y Loyola all that occurred in
the year 1695-1696.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="div1Ref_8.0" href="#div1_8.0">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<h3>THE FIRST AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT MADE BY<br>
FRAY ANDRÉS DE AVENDAÑO Y LOYOLA TO REACH<br>
THE ITZAS OF TAYASAL, 1695-1696</h3>
<p class="continue">It has been pointed out in the Introduction that Avendaño&#39;s Relacion
is of very great value as a first-hand account of the conquest of the Itzas. But
we must not lose sight of the fact that that same Relación is also a wonderful,
though unconscious, testimony to the piety, unselfishness, and bravery of him who
wrote it. Undoubtedly the priests of the Roman Catholic Church did many unjust things
during the period of Spanish domination in the New World, but the number of good
and noble deeds done by them (deeds the bulk of which is unrecorded) completely
dwarfs the evil. Avendaño was a type of the best sort of priest in the New World.
Impelled by no other motive than sheer faith and an ardent desire to do the duty
of his office, he went through the events which we will leave him to relate.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Preamble</b>. &quot;I, Fray Andrés de Avendaño y Loyola, ... accompanied
by my Padres and Preachers Fray Antonio Perez de San Roman, Apostolic notary of
the first trip; Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, Apostolic notary of the second trip,
and Fray Diego de Echebarria, ... made this first trip [beginning] on the 3d of
June of the past year of 1695, and the second, on which we entered the nation of
the Ytzaex, began on the 13th of December of the said year, and we returned to this
city of Merida on the 6th of April of this year of 1696....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Preparations for the Journey</b>. &quot;... Here begins the historical
account, which, with the divine aid, I am attempting to tell of the casualties and
events which happened in this journey for the conversion of souls, while opening
a road from this Province to that of Guatemala, taking as my sure loadstar the honor
and glory of God and the well-being of souls, which, at the cost of unextinguishable
fervor, Señor Don Martin de Urssua y Arismendi<a name="div2Ref_8.1" href="#div2_8.1"><sup>8.1</sup></a> Provisional Governor and Captain-General
of these provinces for his Majesty, is attempting to bring about; with none the
less support of the Señor Oidor Don Francisco de Saraza, who at the present time
resides in the city of Merida de Yucatan. Today, the 2d of June of this present
year 1695 ... I, then, armed with so strong an armor of faith, say that God, our
Lord, having moved the hearts of these two above-mentioned gentlemen, so that, besides
their undertaking other enterprises of his Majesty (whom may God guard), the fervent
zeal of the said Don Martin de Urssua y Arismendi found an opportunity, the Señor
Oidor (as has been said) favoring it, for carrying out a journey,--two messengers
these, both as acceptable to God as deserving in the service of the royal crown,
since in fulfilling the duty of his office of Provisional Governor, [Ursua] did
not waste at all the precious jewel of time, but put into execution, in addition
to the difficult work of government, this most difficult and special work which
his Majesty granted to him of opening the wild road from this province to that of
Guatemala, without satisfying the eagerness of his zeal, in spite of the excessive
cost of the undertaking; for he gave all the supplies necessary for one hundred
and fifteen Spaniards and one hundred and fifty-six Indian musketeers, for which
he, jointly with the Municipality of Campeche and other special friends, paid, joining
mutually not only in the payment of wages, but also sharing the expense of provisions....
Among those who joined in this mission were the Padre Preacher, Fray Juan de San
Buena Ventura, and the Padre Preacher, Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, both living in
the convent of the Santa Recolección of this city of Merida, and Brother Fray Tomás
de Alcoser, lay friar, and Brother Lucas, lay Brother of the said convent. All of
these composed or established one mission. And the Padre Preacher, Fray Antonio
Perez de San Roman, holding the office of apostolic notary, with the lay Brother,
Alonso de Vargas, and I, the most unworthy of all, who went as their delegate apostolic
missionary....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The aforesaid Provisional Governor [Ursua] was not satisfied with
this enterprise alone, and, without considering the greatness of the cost, as his
fidelity to His Majesty developed, he disposed of his services so that at one and
the same time to drive out some Englishmen (as he did with glory enough of his own)
who inhabited the lands of Zacatone, adjoining this province, and who lived there
on account of their large profits in logwood. He gave the assistance needed for
this duty to Captain Bernardo de Lizarraga, and he executed it with double victories;
and then, not sparing the ploughing of the foaming waves, he made four captures
in his first victory, in order to gain his second. As a skillful man he went with
all his men into the wild woods of pathless thickets, where, though with great risk,
falling upon the enemy in the rear, he made his second attack, again gaining as
spoils of his second victory, other prizes, and driving out from there the said
English enemies. I speak no more of this, as it does not belong in this place.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Start</b>. &quot;Therefore in prosecution of the aforesaid trip,
I started with the Padres as my companions on the second day of June of the year
&#39;95, with a very broad mandate which the aforesaid Provisional Governor gave me,
so that I could take the singers and sacristans, who of their free will wished to
follow me; exempting, as a privilege, from taxes, those who followed me, and their
wives and children....&quot;<a name="div2Ref_8.2" href="#div2_8.2"><sup>8.2</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal"><b>Indian Singers</b>. &quot;On my showing the above mandate to the magistrates
of the towns through which I passed, there were at once Indians provided to accompany
me besides those who went with me, who were the following:--</p>
<div style="margin-left:5%">
<p class="continue">Marcos Canul, Master of the Chapel of the town of Calkini.<br>
Lorenzo Yah, servant of Captain Belasco.<br>
Nicolas Mas, singer of Mascanu.<br>
Diego Mo, sacristan of Mascanu.<br>
Diego Cen, collector of alms of San Christobal.<br>
Diego Pol, singer of Telchao.<br>
Francisco Ku, son of Max Chuz, my servant.<br>
Nicolas Mai, singer of Bolonchen, and he died there.<br>
Manuel Piste, singer of Bolonchen de Cauich.<br>
Luis Ci, sacristan of Tepakam.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><b>Arrival at Cauich</b>. &quot;With them I went to the last pueblo of
this province through that part called Cauich, where I found Captain Don Juan del
Castillo, placed there by the Governor, in charge, not only of the soldiers, but
also of their arms, ammunition, and supplies; and he showed himself singularly kind
to us. On the second day, having reached the said town, we found an Indian named
Juan Ake, a native of the pueblo of Hoppelchen, who made many trips in the forests
to trade with the heathen Indians. From him, with some finesse and gentle persuasions,
I extracted the information of three pueblos of heathen Indians, which were found
fifty leagues from there, with the names and descriptions, which we verified afterwards.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Departure from Cauich</b>. &quot;We started from this pueblo of Cauich
well content with this good news in the afternoon of the day of Saint John the Baptist,
after having celebrated his festival with all the spiritual rejoicings which the
starting on such a difficult enterprise demanded, beginning from this afternoon
to reap some fruits of our journey, since we took this journey in retribution of
our sins. In a little while a heavy rain-storm caught us, which lasted from the
evening till the dawn of the next day, with such a tempest of lightnings and thunders
that the mechanism of the celestial orbs seemed to dissolve. The place where we
slept this night is called Hobonmo, two long leagues distant from the said town
of Cauich. Here God worked a manifest miracle with my boy, for a viper of the most
poisonous kind which are found in this province, called in this idiom <i>Kancñah</i>,
came to repose on the mat on which my boy slept, and stayed there resting by the
side of his face, until he moved and gave an opportunity to the frightened boy to
rise; and when we lighted a light, we saw it and the Indians killed it without it
doing any harm.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Aguada of Hobon Ox; Chunzalam, Vecanxan</b>. &quot;We proceeded in the
morning of the next day from the said place, a distance of one league, where we
found a <i>haltun</i>, that is, a hollowed stone, which usually contains water. It is
called Hobon Ox. At the distance of two leagues from this <i>haltun</i> is found another
place called Chunzalam, with an <i>aguada</i> called Kalceh. One league from this place
is found another <i>aguada</i> on the right hand. It is called Vecanxan. A little after
this we found a small plain on the left hand.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>&#39;Nohhalali Th[=a] Ayn, Sucte</b>. &quot;At the distance of three-fourths
of a league is found another <i>aguada</i> called Nohhalal, and after this is found another
<i>aguada</i> called Th[=a] Ayn, and a little further on, something like half a league,
are found some columns of round stone, which the natives say have served as an altar
for the chaplain of the Spaniards, whose Captain is called Mirones. At the side
of the said columns is found a well, narrow and round and somewhat deep, although
the mystery of what its purpose is, is never revealed. At a distance of half a league
from this place is found another <i>haltun</i> with very good water, and a league from
this is found the place called Sucte, worthy of memory on account of the things
which it contains. First, this place is a plain or meadow, the largest which I have
seen up to this time, and it extends on all sides out of sight. The whole covered
with trees with a small fruit called <i>Nanren</i>, and other trees called <i>Guazes</i>,
so that all of them make a design, by their standing in such order that they appear
to have been planted for the purpose. So that this <i>savana</i> is very beautiful on
all sides. In the middle of it is found an <i>aguada</i>, well provided, although in
the dry season it is apt to be dried up. To the South of the said <i>savana</i>, at a
distance of a quarter of a league, within a thicket is found another <i>aguada</i> with
better and more water, from its being spring water. It rises and falls like the
sea, although the sea is distant, from it, in its nearest parts, twenty-six leagues.
It breeds in it very good fish and very large <i>caimans</i>.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Ix Kata-Kal</b>. &quot;At a distance of a league from this place there
is another, Ix Kata-Kal, though it does not always contain water. The said <i>aguada</i>
is found on the Eastern side of the road. On the remainder of this road at a distance
of three leagues, there are only found some <i>haltuns</i> or hollowed stones, which
relieve the necessities of many thirsty people, but not in the dry season. As we
passed by them, all the path was rough and stony, so that from the fatigue of going
over it on foot, we had great trouble from the want of water until we reached a
place called Nohku, to which from the aforesaid <i>savana</i> is four very long leagues.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Nohku</b>. &quot;In this place we experienced comfort enough, since
God had provided us with food and drink enough to aid us in passing the day of the
glorious Apostles, Saint Peter and Saint Paul, so that in that place we said mass.
And in it we found a house of idols, so that, although the Spaniards who passed
first had broken many, we broke more than fifty others, putting in their place a
cross, in order to give to God the reverence and worship which the idolaters of
the place usurped for themselves. From this report which we heard there grew in
us all a Christian curiosity to see the said place in order to exorcise the devil
on account of his frauds and to glorify and praise him who is powerful everywhere.
We came back from seeing the said place about the hour of vespers, which were celebrated
with as much outward and inward rejoicing as was possible in that place. We arranged
the altar as decently as we could, through the influence of which and our own Christian
character, the Indians, without being forced to, also resolved to confess and to
receive the sacraments (for the example of the chiefs is a great thing), so that,
without forcing them by words, their subjects silently followed them....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Nohvecan</b>. &quot;We left this place well contented, although with
our feet wearied and wounded by the roughness of the road and we walked a distance
of four leagues to another place called Nohvecan, which place, for a league before
and a league after, consists of great overflowed stretches which in this language
are called <i>Akalchees</i>. It can be well understood what pain we endured with our
sore legs and feet passing through this two leagues of water and mud, which at the
least came up over our knees, leaving us almost crippled; another great hardship
being added, as soon as we came to an end of this trip, which is the abundance of
mosquitoes, which did not allow us rest by day or night. There is in this place
an <i>aguada</i> which is very large and deep and which in the rainy season becomes a
river full of water. There are found in the said place some trees, the bark of which
is in smell and taste the same as the cinnamon. It is called in this idiom, <i>Ppelizkuch</i>;
also on the paths is found a vine, which, on touching it, smells of garlic. The
odor reaches a distance of a quarter of a league.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Hardships Suffered by the Padres</b>. &quot;This torment was followed
by another very heavy storm of wind which seemed to tear up the trees by the roots,
with a great fall of rain, thunder and lightning, which afflicted our hearts. So
that imitating in our weakness the Apostle Saint Peter in another similar storm,
which befell him on the sea, we had recourse to God with &#39;Lord, save us, we perish&#39;;
though by imitating him in every thing, we deserved the reproval of our weakness,
by the answer which Christ gave to his Apostles, when he calmed the storm by his
power; for there he reproved them with these words, &#39;Why are ye fearful, O ye of
little faith? Wherefore do you doubt?&#39;, his most holy Majesty showing his pity at
once.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Oppol; a Bridge Built across a River</b>. &quot;On the next day early,
warned by what had happened in that place, at the first steps which we took in the
prosecution of our trip, we passed another league of swamp with the same misery
as we had the preceding one, as far as a place called Oppol, which is three leagues
from this place. In it to the Northwest, at a distance of a quarter of a league,
is found a deep <i>aguada</i>, from which our company provided itself with water needed
for consumption. Two leagues from this place, beyond a deserted old town, there
is found a running stream (although accidental) so that, to pass over it, we made
a bridge. The water is very good, though in the rainy season it will be difficult
to pass, like many others which we have found dry, through our not having come in
the rainy season; for when the force of the river comes through the said places,
the roads would be impassable.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Tanche</b>. &quot;Two leagues beyond this river is found a place called
Tanche, which is found on the brow of a lofty hill-top and in sight of another very
high ridge in a westerly direction from this rancho. At more than half a league
off is found the <i>aguada</i> from which the thirsty satisfy their need. A league and
a half from this <i>rancho</i> towards the South (we follow this direction) is found
another permanent river with an artificial bridge, which cannot be passed in any
other way. All the roads are very much overflowed on account of the many ridges
which surround them. They call this river Yochalek.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Deserted Village of Temchay</b>. &quot;From this place to an old deserted
town called Temchay is three leagues. It has its <i>aguada</i>, but it does not contain
water except in the rainy season. We suffered great thirst, because we had come
with the hope that we should satisfy our needs there, and we did not find anything
but hard work enough, in repeating our day&#39;s march, and in the fact that the hills
were rough with many ups and downs, and with more footprints of mountain Indians,
who passed by there, although these footprints were not recent.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Nohpek</b>. &quot;Suffering from the scarcity of water, we continued
our way for the space of three leagues farther, to a great <i>haltun</i>, or hollowed
stone, which held a great deal of water and which God willed that we should find
full. This place is called Nohpek. At the side of this <i>haltun</i> we found a <i>milpa</i>
well sown and provided with <i>chiles</i>, which in the midst of our work served our
hunger, so that, with a little maize which we cooked, we had that day a cheerful
meal; although to the cheer there did not fail to be added a little bitterness;
since in one of the <i>ranchos</i> where we lodged we found a tree which in that language
is called <i>Pomolche</i>. This produced a fruit of the same form as the hazel nuts of
Spain, as well in the shell as in the kernel, color, smell, and taste. Curiosity
led us to see if they were really hazel nuts. We ate some of the kernels for some
time, without finding any difference. Therefore as quite a time passed in which
there was no effect other than what we expected, the Indians ate also, so as to
imitate us in everything. Eating the said kernels caused us some thirst, giving
us occasion to drink water, and we had scarcely drunk it, when we all burst out
with vomitings and violent diarrhoeas. Two leagues on from this place, a part of
the army of Spaniards was found, and knowing that I was on the way, there came to
receive me two priests who were of those who had preceded me, with two soldiers;
and one of them, having had the same thing happen to him with the said fruit, said
that their remedy was a draught of wine. We took the remedy and after we had purged
ourselves thoroughly, we were, of a sudden, well.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Nohthub</b>. &quot;From this place it is two long leagues to an old
deserted place called Nohthub; all the way is overflowed or <i>akalchex</i>. In the rainy
season the road is very heavy. In this place we found the camp of the Captain Don
Joseph de Estenos, with all his people. It is a pleasant place and has many orange
and lemon trees. In it we saw a large enclosure which the Indians made to keep off
the Spaniards, when the latter went to despoil them fifteen years before. It has
two large <i>aguadas</i>, one at the entrance of the said place, which in the dry season
is exhausted; with another large and round basin which God made in a living rock.
Another <i>aguada</i> lies in an easterly direction, a distance of half a league, and
the water here is permanent and deep. It breeds very good fish of large size and
tame, so that, although the soldiers went in swimming, the fish did not flee away,
so that they gave an opportunity to any one who had a <i>machete</i> in his hand to kill
them. They call these fish crocodiles, because they are of the same shape and with
the same scales as crocodiles, and they are very good eating, according to the statement
of all who eat them.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Bacechac</b>. &quot;From this Nohthub we went five good leagues to a
place which they call Bacechac. In its center are three <i>aguadas</i>, but all were
dry. There is much overflowed land or <i>akalchex</i>. There are very large forests with
many copal and balsam trees, and many hills, on account of which the paths are impassable
in the rainy season. This place has its <i>aguada</i> in a westerly direction, and although
it too held no water, necessity made us experts, making deep holes in some parts
of it, in order that the land should distil its moisture. So it happened, God giving
us sufficient water from night to morning in the said wells which we opened to relieve
our need.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;We left this place the next day and traveled about two leagues by some
places which are very much submerged and not the less dangerous, as much on account
of the hills which surround them as from the chance streams which are met there,
until at last we reached a summit which forms on the top a great plain, in which
is found an <i>aguada</i> called Celmet.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Buete</b>. &quot;In this place the same thing happened to us (as far
as water is concerned) as in the preceding <i>aguada</i>. We left this place and traveled
some two leagues and a half to a place called Buete. In this place we found twelve
or thirteen houses of the heathen Indians, who had just surrendered to the Indian
soldiers of Sahcabchen, without any violence, as I shall explain hereafter. This
place has a very large <i>aguada</i> with much eel-grass and very many <i>caimans</i>. In
this town and two others near by we found ample supplies of maize, beans and the
rest of the fruits on which all live in this land; and it came very opportunely,
since already the army had no other recourse, after the hunger which they had endured
for three days past....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Lack of Supplies</b>. &quot;It happened then that the captains found
themselves in want of supplies, and that they wrote several letters to Captain Don
Juan del Castillo about the transportation of some supplies which some muleteers
of the town of Teabo left in one of the aforementioned places called Tzucte, at
a distance of eight leagues from Cauich, which supplies I saw when I passed through
it, as well as the letters which were written about the despatch of provisions,
and in spite of these letters or other special exertions in sending soldiers with
mules from the camp for the supplies, they effected nothing....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Parades Seizes Some Farms</b>. &quot;Seeing then such a clear and extreme
need. Captain Alonso Garcia de Paredes, the head and leader of the other captains,
determined to send Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, with some Spanish armed soldiers, following
some confused rumors which an Indian named Juan Ake, who had guided them, had spoken
of. He it is who mentioned these three <i>ranchos</i> in my presence in the town of Cauich.
And although it is true, that there he mentioned these <i>ranchos</i>, here he appeared
in doubt in speaking with the captains, showing himself to be totally ignorant of
such towns, he being the cause that these Spaniards lost themselves in those forests.
But the soldiers, availing themselves of their agility, climbed the trees and the
hill-tops, from which they discovered a great smoke, and they went on in that direction;
and having come up to it, they saw that there were the soldiers of the town of Zahcabchen,
who, by order of Captain Alonso Garcia de Paredes, came out from another direction
to the abandoned town of Tzucthok, which the said Captain with these soldiers had
destroyed fifteen years since. Therefore he knowing beforehand of the said farms,
gave orders that they should proceed to take possession of them before the Spaniards
whom he had brought with him should come up. The Indians obeyed the orders of their
Captain, and entered upon the farms with great imprudence, shooting without any
cause, and killing till they had killed five Indians, without more reason than that
of the avarice which led them to inspire the owners with fear, so that they should
flee, as many did, in order to rob them safely of as much as they possessed; as
they did. And to me it is evident that they made a very imprudent entry on to these
farms.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Fifty-one Indians of Buete Surrender</b>. &quot;Notwithstanding this
imprudence, fifty-one Indians delivered themselves up, with their wives and children.
These were from the said town of Buete, besides those who had fled from Kantemo,
and from the town of Yames, now today called the town of the dead, from the five
aforesaid having died there. Of these Indians who gave themselves up, two were left
as guides and the rest, with their wives and children, they took as prisoners to
the said abandoned town of Tzucthok. The two guides who remained I treated kindly
and with special attention, as the first fruit of our love, I mean, of our labors,
and this they surely recognized, for from the love they felt for me, they embraced
me and asked me that I should be a petitioner for them to the Captain Alonso Garcia,
so that he should tell his soldiers that they should return all the clothing and
wax which they had collected; since they themselves had neither resisted nor defended
themselves, but had on the other hand surrendered voluntarily, when they might have
run away and did not do so; but calling out to the soldiers, they not only surrendered
themselves, but acted as guides to the other towns, at the convenient hour of dawn,
so that they gathered them all in without any noise;--they call all these Indians
who voluntarily surrendered, the Mayas.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Avendaño Argues with Paredes about his Plundering</b>. &quot;In compliance
with the request which the two pagan Indians made me, and having placed It before
the Captain, I gained my point by giving him advice; telling him in my remarks that
he should consider that in that first public act lay the success of the rest, so
that it was of great importance for him to carry into effect the justice which the
two pagan Indians asked for; and I asked this for many reasons, the first;--because
it was the service of God, law and reason and in conformity with the charity which
we ought to show towards our neighbors and with the good example which in the present
case we ought to set.... The next reason is, if we show them justice, it would follow,
that, even if some of them fled, they would proclaim the good deeds of the Spaniards,
and the rest of the people of the towns which we should come to in the future, would
not run away; and if they did not flee, they would serve with me as messengers,
so that through spreading the report of the good treatment which had been shown
them, the other townspeoples would not refuse to surrender.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Royal Decrees are Mentioned by Avendaño</b>. &quot;The last thing
which I placed before him was the large number of decrees which His Majesty (may
God guard him) had despatched, and those which his predecessors of eternal memory
had despatched, which affirm the same thing which I asked him, as in the case of
the first instructions, which were given (by the mandate of our Catholic King) to
the Admiral Christopher Colon....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The same thing was urged afterwards by the same
Catholic Kings, in the year 1501, upon the Commander, Nicolas de Ovando, when he
went to govern the island of Santo Domingo, and this decree reads as follows:--that
he should arrange with great vigilance and care that all the Indians of Española
should be free from slavery, and that they should not be molested by any one, but
that they should live as free vassals, governed and guarded in justice and that
they should arrange so that they be instructed in the holy Catholic faith; since
his intention was that they should be treated with love and kindness, without permitting
that any one should do them harm; so that they should not be hindered in receiving
our holy faith and so that they should not hate the Christians for their deeds,
etc.&#39;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And many other decrees were issued thereafter for the same purpose, the same
thing being repeated and urged by an infinite number of decrees and ordinances of
the Emperors, Charles V, Philip II and III and up to Philip IV....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Paredes Promises to Return the Plunder</b>. &quot;All these reasons
which I gave to the said Captain, Alonso Garcia de Paredes, struck him favorably
and he gave me his word to coöperate in my request, causing their clothes and the
rest of the things which had been taken from them to be returned to the Indian prisoners,
promising at the same time to punish the transgressors, as soon as he reached the
said abandoned Tzucthok.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Paredes Fails to Keep his Word</b>. &quot;And when he reached there,
I reminded him of the said promise, but as avarice drew him more than charity, he
answered me with scorn, saying, &#39;God be with you. Padre, how can you expect me to
know now who was the man who robbed the prisoners?&#39; At this time there came one
of the offending soldiers to speak to him. He was wearing loose breeches made of
the clothing which they had stolen from the aforesaid Indians; and I, answering
his rough suggestion, said to him:--&#39;See, Señor Captain, that there is standing
near you one who knows of or is the doer of the theft, since the breeches of this
soldier of yours show it.&#39; He replied:--Padre, those are his perquisites, which
I cannot take away.&#39; And at the same time, turning his back to me, he said to him:--&#39;Take
notice, man, that I hold you responsible for paying for all the wax which you and
the rest of you hold.&#39; So that the special result of this trip can well be understood
to be quite contrary to the service of God and of the King, and very useful only
to the special ends of the avarice of the soldiers.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;I, seeing this coldness, in
the beginning, never supposed that the results would be happy, so that I felt sad
enough; since it would have been better not to have started out on such an enterprise,
if I was to see such inhumanities....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Tzucthok, once before Reduced, had Rebelled</b>. &quot;By our lengthened
stay in this aforesaid abandoned town of Tzucthok, we had an opportunity of gaining
a better understanding of its ruins. This is a town,--one of those which our Padre,
Fray Christoval Sanchez, brought into obedience, though afterwards the people became
rebellious. Today the forked poles which his holiness placed in the church he built
are still standing. It is a very pleasant place, although unhealthful on account
of the lightness of the winds. The water is pure, but also of a hardness which makes
it excessively harmful. There are many cocoa-nut palm trees, many fruit trees, particularly
lemons. Before reaching this place there is a large spring or river beneath the
ground, so that for the distance of a league, the path goes following its banks
and the bed of the said river. It is to be understood that in the rainy season it
is full of water. There is good hunting in the woods, especially peacocks and pheasants.
The most common animal in these woods is a leopard or false lion, with a red skin
and with spots of various colors. The natives call it <i>Chacekel</i>. Among the birds
are some which are very different from those of the Province. I heard a little bird
warble, which I knew at once was a linnet like those of Spain; it imitated it much
in its song as in its size, though not in its plumage. There is another bird with
a body of a hen of Castile, called <i>Pan</i>. Its beak is very long and thick; up to
the middle it is yellow and the other half green; its feathers correspond, being
very yellow from below the beak to its belly. The rest of the body is black, except
under the tail, which has a red plumage; the legs are green and in spite of so much
beauty, it utters only shrieks....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Endeavor to Instruct the Indians</b>. &quot;In these affairs,
besides educating those who had been lately gathered together, although they might
never be freed from slavery, we passed our time till the 24th of July, when we heard
news that the road openers would shortly come to a certain town of the nation of
the Cehaches; and in order not to fail as in the previous case, we priests planned
to speak plainly with the captains and to find out what their plan was to be on
entering it; for if it was not more decent and Christian than in the past, we had
determined to avoid the occasion of disturbance, by returning to the Province, rather
than see cruel deeds performed....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Captains Promise to Give Warning before Fighting</b>. &quot;The
captains ... promised their assent to the advice which we might give them hereafter,
adding that, when an opportunity offered to enter any town, a proclamation should
be issued, with a penalty of death on any one who should dare to go against it....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>A Skirmish</b>. &quot;At this time the Indian road openers went on with
their work, bringing as their guard the Indian musketeers from Sahcabchen, who never
did anything well, owing to the said Captain Alonso, who, on account of his interest
in their spoils, sends them out by themselves, without any Spanish people of intelligence
to oversee that their duties are performed in a proper way. While engaged in this,
they discovered a town of the Cehaches, Chunpich, already abandoned, as they had
heard the rumor of the Spaniards, on account of which they found in one house only
twenty-five loads of maize. Seeing many traces of people, they entered in fear,
and notifying the said captain of their having discovered the said town, they all
asked him for reinforcements, since they feared a hard fight. He gave them the reinforcements
they asked for, together with their arms, though they did not arrive in time, since
before they arrived there came as many as twenty-five Indians with their baskets
for that maize which they had left. The soldiers, well prepared, carried their arms
for whatever might turn up, since going prepared with arms was always the cause
of many victories as opposed to many defeats. On the other hand they do less harm,
the better provided they are. So it happened to these men; since having posted six
Indian musketeers as sentinels in the direction they supposed the ruined town lay,
so as to defend themselves and the workmen on the road, until their reinforcements
arrived, it happened that the sentinels, seeing the said twenty-five Indians coming,
they seemed to them to be thousands, and with the fear which never accomplished
a good thing and with their evil disposition, which always has done much harm, without
letting them enter so as to direct their fire well, our men broke ranks, which not
only gave our opponents a better chance to get ready for a battle, but also frightening
more the rest of our men who became aware of the retreat, made them hastily and
heedlessly attribute the victory to our enemies. At that time, the reinforcement
of our men coming up, the timid sentinels, deserting their posts, came back to make
part of the reinforcement which was coming to them. When all were together they
rushed to battle, which our opponents, like brave men, won finely, wounding three
of our men without any of them being wounded. The remainder of our men fled and
our opponents, laughing, left them and took their way with cries to those forests
by the path on which they all lived. Our men returned to follow that path about
four leagues; in that district they found two towns without inhabitants, though
they were well provided with farms with all their products. These they ate and carried
off as a token of their valor, giving as an excuse of their unfortunate fight, that
their opponents were not men but demons, not endowed with reason, but brutes, since,
without fear of death, they flung themselves savagely on the guns.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Avarice of Paredes</b>. &quot;All this happened to the Captain [Paredes]
through avarice, for, on account of avarice, he did not wish to send respectable
and honorable Spaniards, who might obtain with good judgment victories in these
engagements, but only his Indians from Cahcabchen, so that by frightening the other
Indians, they should enter safely into the houses in order to steal as much as the
poor Indians have in their houses, as happened in the preceding case that I refer
to above. We all inferred that all this was with the permission of the said Captain,
since, seeing the feelings, which we showed at his not having kept his promise to
us, given at the conference which we had had, not only did he not punish the transgressors,
but neither did he make amends for the casualties which might necessarily have happened,
it being the fact that we suggested the remedy in both cases, and he appeased us
with kind words....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Chunpich is Reached</b>. &quot;After this unfortunate engagement the
whole camp went along to the said town of Chunpich, distant eight long leagues from
this town of Tzucthok, and the Captains, addressing me, asked me to stay with my
companions to look after those Indians and children, besides some sick Indians,
educating them and instructing them as I ought; and if by chance they should find
a town, they would notify me, so that I could come to catechize them. I accepted
this proposal for the future, carrying out his orders at the present time, and having
known that the said captains had passed forwards from the said village of Chunpich,
I got ready to go alone with four Indian singers to the said town, and by inspecting
or cutting down all their thickets, to see if I could meet with the Cehaches Indians
who made war on the Spaniards, in order to draw them to the bosom of our Holy Mother
Church. I went through the said forests to a great distance, and in all directions
and I did not meet any one. At this time I received information (although it was
confused) that, after the said town of Chunpich was passed, on the road to the South
which we were following in a Southeast direction, an indistinct foot path had been
discovered. As I knew that on the said route lay the nation of the Ytzaes, for meeting
whom I have been preparing for some years, by having learned their language, it
was necessary to set about following the path which the Spaniards were taking, in
order to verify my suspicions; but it verified nothing but constant misfortunes;
since on the path I met four Indian musketeers of the town of Sahcabchen, whom their
captain was sending as slaves to the quiet of his house. They brought me a letter
from the Captain, Don Joseph de Estenos, in which he told me that he had found three
other towns without inhabitants, though with some little rotten corn; and that the
third leader, Don Pedro de Suviaur by name, had gone with his men to another town
which they supposed belonged to the Ytzaes. This letter reached me a league and
a half from Chunpich, at a very large <i>aguada</i> which there is there, and at three
long leagues from there is another large abandoned town called Ixbam.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Zuviaur Goes to the Itzas; the Padres Return</b>. &quot;I returned unhappy
when I thought of the little result which had come in the said town of Chunpich,
and I took pleasure in its suburbs to divert my sorrow, since this place is very
pleasant. A lake lies towards the West, so large that it stretches out of sight.
The water is very good, the two other towns of which I spoke above being around
the said lake. The Spaniards found these at the time of the fight, all very full
of fruits and abundant corn-fields, which the captain wished to have trampled down
and destroyed so that their owners might come and give themselves up. But we did
not consent to this; I was taking great pleasure in looking at the said lake, when
an Indian came whom I had sent to camp, with letters from the Governor, and besides
confirming the news which the said Captain, Don Joseph, had written me, he stated
to me that he had known how the third leader Don Pedro de Zuviaur had gone to one
of the towns of the Ytzaes. I regretted this last more than the rest, since I was
holding the said towns reserved for the purpose of going to them without their hearing
any rumors of soldiers.... I returned more sad than I had been at first. I went
to the town of Tzucthok, where my companion Padres were, looking after the management
of those Indians who had been allotted to me.... As I considered our work useless,
since they had depopulated eight towns of the Cehaches, without any results, to
see also that they had reached the Ytzaes, whom also they were going to spoil was
the cause of the greatest sorrow.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Further Troubles</b>. &quot;I discussed with my companion Padres the
troubles which followed,--now on account of the Indians, who were fleeing every
day, now of the need which they had of supplies, now of the continual rains which
caused these places to be overflowed, by which speedy ruin was threatened, now of
the injustice which the said captains showed us....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Without giving me anything
to do, nor allotting me Indians to catechize and manage in the future, the said
captain took away from me those of whom I had charge, and whom I not only catechized
but also baptized and married, without paying attention to the despatch of his Majesty,
which prohibits the changing of the residence of the Indians who had recently been
converted, on account of the risk of their lives which would follow; as Solorzano
cites them and quotes them,--one of which says &#39;that too hard work should not be
given them and they should not be taken to distant places, and that above all their
health and preservation should be looked after, without taking them to a sky, climate
or temperature which are different or contrary to those to which they are accustomed.&#39;
...&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Determine to Get to the Itzas Some Other Way</b>. &quot;We
then, seeing all these troubles and injustices, in order to avoid the contest and
disturbances which could not be remedied, together with all the inconveniences,
risks and dangers which in the time of so great rains, each day brought to us, determined
to return to the Province, with the intention to send word about everything to our
Very Reverend Padre Provincial from the first town of the Province and to take from
there the road in a different direction, which I knew of, so as to go without any
noise of arms to the nation of the heathen Ytzaes, passing through the nation of
the Indians of Tipu. This is a direction opposite to that which the Spaniards took;
so that we could obtain in this way something of our objects and end, which we always
had before us, of going alone without soldiers or armed men, for the conversion
of the said heathen, to which from the beginning we had dedicated ourselves....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Letter to the Captains</b>. &quot;Agreeing then with my companions,
the Padres, in this good suggestion, I wrote a letter to the captains, taking leave
of them, without giving the reason why I returned, but stating that it was on account
of a slight accident that had happened to me; they, whom their consciences must
have accused, supposing that I should set forth there in this Province before the
Governor, who had sent me, their improper methods of acting, determined maliciously,
for their greater satisfaction, to justify themselves by forestalling, me, with
charges against me, as if I should pay any attention to them....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Governor Ursua Vexed by the Captains&#39; Letter</b>. &quot;The Governor
was vexed with this letter which the Captain Alonso Garcia wrote to him, seeing
that he had chosen me to carry out his purpose, and then seeing that I gave him
a slap in the face by returning without any reason, as they wrote him; for which
reason he suspended judgment till he had news of my coming to the Province, to inform
himself of the truth. At this time we arrived on our return, with hard work enough
on account of so many wild thickets, as I spoke of in the beginning, and of all
the overflowed lands, deep in water, since our return was made in the season of
heaviest rains, at the first town of the Province called Hopelchen, whence I wrote
to my Prelate of the resolution which we had taken of returning to the Ytzaes by
another route, since on the one we had started on, our work was stopped. I received
a reply from my Prelate by which he said he expected me in the City, without informing
us that we should go back by the way we suggested.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Return to Merida</b>. &quot;We came to his presence and entered the
City on Saturday the 16th of September of the said year 1695....&quot;</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="div1Ref_9.0" href="#div1_9.0">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<h3>THE SECOND ENTRADA OF PADRE AVENDAÑO</h3>
<p class="continue">The first entrada being spoiled on account of trouble with the
soldiers, Avendaño remained in the province until October 4, 1695. On that day news
reached him from a Spanish resident of Bacalar, called Francisco de Ariza, that
the nation of the Itzas, who numbered eighty thousand fighting men, had expressed
their willingness to receive Christianity. This news pleased the Governor (Ursua)
because the Itzas were now the only obstacle that lay between him and the completion
of the Guatemala-Yucatan highway. Accordingly arrangements were concluded according
to the terms of which Avendaño was once more to attempt to bring the Itzas to the
Church. At his own wish he and his priests were to do this alone without the retarding
influences arising from the presence of soldiers. Avendaño asked for and received
various letters and documents in which the policies he was to follow and the authority
with which he was invested were very fully set forth.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Orders of the Governor</b>. One thing is particularly striking
in connection with all the conquests of the Spaniards in America, and that is the
very divergent attitudes toward the natives assumed by the Church and State on the
one hand and by the soldiery and colonists on the other. Nowhere does this difference
come out more clearly than in the matter of the entradas of Avendaño. As that writer&#39;s
report of the papers given to him by Governor Ursua just before he set out on his
second trip is rather long, I will give an extract of it in order that the reader
may see just what was desired by the Padres and by the Governor.</p>
<p class="normal">In the first place
the Governor ordered that Avendaño and his companions be given all necessary horses,
Indians, and other equipment. He also ordered Paredes, who had caused so much trouble
before, to observe carefully the wishes of His Majesty as expressed in the famous
cedula of 1526. In that cedula it was urged that the Indians be turned from their
evil ways; that any necessary houses, fortresses, and other buildings be erected;
that Christianity be introduced among the Indians; that colonization from Spain
should be encouraged in a number of ways; and a number of other wise provisions
were recommended.<a name="div2Ref_9.1" href="#div2_9.1"><sup>9.1</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal"><b>Departure of Avendaño</b>. We will allow Avendaño (pp. 22v-29v,
49v-66r) to tell of the trip in his own words. &quot;With all these papers and the benediction
of my Prelate, I took my departure in the name of God from this City of Merida on
the 13th day of December of this year 1695, in the company of my companion priests,
who were the Padre Preacher, Fray Antonio Peres de San Roman, who also accompanied
me in the first trip; the Padre Preacher Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, who from the
other mission of the Reverend Padre Commissioner Fray Juan de Chaves (being his
Apostolic Notary) passed to my mission with the blessing and consent of the Prelate
Superior; and the Padre Preacher, Fray Diego de Echavarria, with a lay brother of
the holy convent, all of whom united in the love of God and in charity burning to
rescue the souls of those infidel and heathen Ytzaes from the power of Satan in
which, through their idolatry, they were plunged for so many centuries.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Same Route Followed as Before; Batcab is Reached</b>. &quot;We went
through the same ways and places as the first time, till we came to a town of the
nation of the Cehaches, called Batcab, in which we met General Alonso Garcia de
Paredes, with a captain called Don Pedro Zuviaur, an engineer or guide who was going
in the direction in which they were opening the road from this province to that
of Guatemala.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Chuntucí</b>. &quot;The next day, which was that of the Holy Kings,
on January 6th of this year of &#39;96, I said mass, which the army listened to; after
which we started from the town for Chuntucí of the said nation of the Cehaches,
which is four leagues of very bad roads during the rainy season, on account of the
many overflowed and dangerous places that there are in them in some parts which
they call in this language <i>akalchees</i> or <i>hulbalex</i>, and in Castilian <i>pantanos</i>.
On the said road likewise are found two rivers in the first league,--a small one
which is not permanent except in the rainy season; as is the case with an <i>aguada</i>
which is found in the middle of the road on the slope of a ridge which is ascended
in times of rain with some difficulty, although the other river, which is found
about three leagues off, is permanent, the water of which, though it is somewhat
sluggish, for they say it is a river of copper, nevertheless is very cool and raises
very good fish, though not very large ones. A league and a half from this river
is the said town of Chuntucí, which consists of not more than eight houses close
together, though there are many others in the corn fields a little more or less
distant, in a circuit of about half a league.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;We journeyed from this town of Chuntucí
in a southerly direction a distance of a good league, where there is a great overflowed
space or <i>aguada</i>, which in this tongue is called <i>nohcib</i>, in the midst of which
is discovered a great <i>aguada</i>, which without doubt is the origin or cause of some
great river of those which flow to the Laguna de Terminos. At half a league beyond
this we came across a little crystal stream, which left us in the belief that it
had its origin from a great swamp near there towards the East, which is dimly seen
on the other side of this little stream. About six quarters of a league from here,
we discovered an indistinct little path in the direction of the South-east, following
which without suspicion, though we were armed, we rushed forward with eager confidence,
following the path through the thickets without fearing any shipwreck, saying the
prayer &#39;<i>in exitu Israel de Egiptu</i>&#39; that we may imitate in their victory the Israelites,
who succeeded in passing through the waves of the Red Sea. We followed the said
path for some distance, during which we fell in with the <i>Batchee</i>, or signs which
assured us that we were on the path to the nation of the heathen Ytzaes. So indistinct
was the path in itself, that to tell whether or not it was a path, required that
<i>Batchee</i>, which was what we followed. After half a league of this road, we came
across a little stream. It is called Chinchinucum, in the language of the Cehaches.
Two leagues from there we found another larger stream, called Nohucum; at half a
league farther on, a great <i>aguada</i> called Akalcay. Two leagues and a half on the
right is found a great pond, called Yavilain; another two leagues and a half from
there is an <i>aguada</i> called Chuncopo. This is an accidental <i>aguada</i> in the middle
of the road, which has abundance of water in the rainy season, from its being in
the midst of low hills and <i>akalchees</i>. Beyond this place is a great ravine, which
in this language is called <i>nohem</i>. It is about a league and a half [long]. This
ravine they call the &#39;Hell of the Ytzaes&#39; from the danger of its descent, on account
of its being necessary that the road should go through it, though we passed many
others which are more dangerous and worse than this ravine. On account of the impossibility
of the passage which they had described to us, it being necessary to pass through
it, so as to carry out our special undertaking and in order to accomplish it the
better and to facilitate the passage, we chose as its patron Saint our Padre San
Antonio of Padua, by whose intercession, without doubt, the passage of the said
ravine became much easier for us than they had described to us up to this time;
we did not fail to pass over some hard hills and rough roads, but from here they
were the worst of all I had seen up to this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Hardships of the Journey</b>. &quot;Two leagues from this ravine
we began to hesitate about the road, because we met with a large river, although
it was then dry; but in the rainy season, it is plainly seen, it carries a great
mass of water. On account of this we found a variety of passages and <i>Batchees</i>,
but, thanks to God and good fortune, in the courses of this dry river, which is
called Cohucum, we recognized some mud or signs of earth among its pebbles, so that
by following this sign for a long distance, we not only came across, in a bend of
the river, a spring of water, to satisfy our need of drinking which we already felt,
but also we recognized on its banks the <i>Batchee</i> and the lost path, so that at
one time we had two consolations. We slept there, though it was very early when
we reached there, for fear of the scarcity of water, which we had already experienced.
But in the morning we had occasion in a short time to be vexed at so much water,
since at a short distance we fell in with a stream more annoying than if it had
been filled with water, though the water which it carried was sufficient to drench
us, since we were not able to pass over it in all cases without going through it.
One has to cross this river in the space of a league very nearly fifty times, so
that it not only annoyed us by wetting us so much more, but because at each turn
we lost the track or footprints which we were following; so that we were delayed
enough in passing the said turns of the river.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;After a great storm they say fair
weather follows, but the contrary happened to us, since, trusting in the abundance
of water, we neither drank, since it was in the morning, nor did we carry it with
us, supposing that we should find it at each step, but what happened to us was to
meet with a great multitude of very rough ascents and descents,--all hills and very
high mountains of limestone, which extended over a space of four leagues, so that,
besides the path in itself being so rough, thirst was troublesome enough. We found
ourselves in the midst of this anguish when of a sudden we came on a descent as
rough and steep as it was long and dangerous; for, though we had no load to carry,
we had to make use of the trees so as not to slip, since if we slipped, there was
no place to stop till we reached the bottom, where we saw a horrible lime cavern
which we supposed would hold water. But it was not so.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Approaching the Itzas</b>. &quot;From the top then of this hill, which
I speak of, there was discovered a great range of low hills, of such a kind that
it not only appeared another country, since even from the top of the trees we did
not discover the land beyond or the part on the other side of this height. We thought
that we doubtless were in another new territory and near the Ytza nation, to which
we were going. At a distance of half a league from this descent, we came across
a great spring of water, which was able with its force to turn many mills, and howsoever
great the pleasure was which we felt at seeing it, just as much disgust did the
taste of it cause us, since it sprang from the brow of a very high hill or steep
rock, but it was all mixed with lime, and was of a lead and sulphur color, and like
this also was its weight and taste. But we did not refrain from drinking it on this
account, since thirst appeared to us of worse taste and weight, although of little
advantage was it to us, since in a short time after we experienced that weight and
bad taste, and the fatigue of the road which we traveled, we came in about a league
upon a great pond, where we camped for sleeping that night, since we had found there
such good accommodation.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Tan Xuluc Mul; Temples on a Great Height</b>. &quot;Having come then
to this pond of Tan xuluc mul an hour before sunset, we had to observe and wonder
with pleasure and delight, since the water which we found was very fine and good.
We found the hut already made, since undoubtedly the Ytzaes kept up that place either
for occupation from time to time or as a permanent dwelling, for there are very
many of them in those places. We had to observe and wonder on some rocks or buildings
on some high places,--so high that they were almost lost to sight. And when we caught
sight of them clearly, the sun shining on them in full, we took pleasure in seeing
them; and we wondered at their height, since without any exaggeration it seemed
impossible that that work could have been done by hand, unless it was with the aid
of the devil, whom they say they adore there in the form of a noted idol. We, with
great zeal which aided us, determined to go up and break it; and, as for me, most
of those who know me know that the lightness of my feet corresponds to the passion
of my zeal to destroy it. But I did not find a trail by which the idolaters go up,
and, even if I had found it, the ascent was always difficult for me on account of
the great height on all sides.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;This ridge continued along the way we traveled for
a distance of five leagues, with very dangerous ascents and descents.... With these
difficulties we came across, at the end of five leagues, a large <i>peten</i> of water,
by which we unexpectedly found ourselves surrounded; and though we were pleased
with the water, our pleasure was drowned in the inconvenience of the place for sleeping....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Chakan Itza</b>. &quot;This <i>aguada</i> or <i>peten</i> is called Ychmuxan,
from which to the Chakan Ytza, there are three leagues, most of them consisting
of very low woods or underbrush, since the whole is mixed up, so that neither are
they <i>Akalchees</i> nor do they cease being so. These are great overflowed tracts,
impossible to be walked on in the rainy season and even in dry times. He alone may
walk there, who should wish to expiate thoroughly his sins, but for any other purpose
only a desperate man would do so, since such woods as those are of the kind which
they call <i>tocolchees</i>,--that is a labyrinth or confusion or hodge-podge of all
weeds or thorny plants, so that I do not know how we brought our clothes and legs
out from amongst them. All these sorrows and sufferings were signs of the pleasure
which we were to receive on that day. In all the said three leagues there is found
at each step a stream of moderate volume, though there is no passage, except, when
following its banks, one can meet with the Chakan Ytzaes, as we did, about three
o&#39;clock in the afternoon of the evening before the day of the name of Jesus, which
my holy religion celebrates on the 13th of January....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Chakan Itzas</b>. &quot;To cross to the other side of the river,
which is called Caclemacal, and to reach the first settlement of the Chacan Ytzaes
was one and the same thing; at which, putting behind us and forgetting all our preceding
difficulties, our hearts considered themselves satisfied and well repaid with the
delight and spiritual consolation which we received at seeing ourselves at the entrance
of the mine where we were to meet with the precious or polished stone, which was
to be either the glorious ornament of our crown, if we were worthy of dying for
the faith which, with the help of God, we were going to plant, or the fruitful result
of those laborious steps which, with the said aid of heaven, we intended to bring
about....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Treatment of the Natives</b>. &quot;We entered then this first settlement
situated on the opposite side of the river of Caclemacal about four quarters of
a league away. In the middle of which we met an Indian woman, wife of the brother
of the cacique Ahcan, a near relative of the petty King of Peten Ytza, who, with
two of her small children, was coming to the said river for water; but when they
saw us at a distance,--three priests clothed with our priestly garments, which had
never been seen by them, and the four Indian singers who were traveling with us,
with the garb of the cloaks or <i>ayates</i> which they wore, very different from their
own garments and from those of the three Cehaches Indians, whom we took along as
guides, they ran away excitedly,--mother and children,--as if we might kill them,
so that it was no little work that we had to pacify them with gentle words and loving
caresses, though we had more trouble in quieting the minds of the brother-in-law,
the cacique and the other Indian authorities, who in a moment ran together at their
cries, all with the intention of making war on us, for they all came with bows and
arrows in their hands.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;But as we wished to sow in their hardened hearts the pure
grain of evangelical seed which should have a more fruitful growth than that which
fell among the thistles and thorns, we began as genuine workmen of Christ to till
the soil of their hearts with the loving hoe of caresses, embracing them joyfully,
as one who had fallen in with the ewe which had been lost for so many centuries,
(the influence of our soft words and the moderation of our prudent acts, resisting
all the weight of their immoderate acts) at which most people were frightened; and
we gave them at the same time some of the Spanish things which we carried, as necessary
and required for attracting their unruly spirits, for this calmed and quieted them
more than the caresses which we had given them. This entry into the said settlement
or village was on the 13th of January, on which my seraphic religion celebrates
the vespers of the holy name of Jesus, and at the very hour of vespers....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;With
their spirits now peaceful and happy, they entertained us on that afternoon and
night, with such a confusion of shouts and outcries in their songs, that, had we
not considered that those extravagant signs of joy were the wild ways of those rural
hills and the fashion with them, our hearts would have suffered some anxiety and
sadness, the more so when we saw before us, those carved, striped and painted faces,
made in the very likeness of the devil.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Please Other Indians by Means of Little Gifts</b>. &quot;I
gave them, as they came up to the novel sight, some necklaces and other trinkets
and trifles for their wives and daughters, and for the men some knives, for the
desire to possess which all came again, thus obliging me to give them presents a
second time, all which I did with pleasure, one reason being the abundance of what
our benefactors in their kind zeal had given me, and the other in order to draw
them to our Catholic faith, which comes to them more through the eye than through
the hearing, since they are covetous in the extreme. They approached me to get what
I had remaining in some hampers, in which I carried for the petty King an entire
suit of clothes, in the fashion of the Indians of this Province, which the Governor
gave me, and other things which I was carrying for the chiefs of Peten Ytza, in
order the better to gain their good will, besides other things necessary for our
ministry and support. And they made a request of me to let them see these things,
carried away by their gross inquisitiveness as much as by their excessive covetousness.
And scarcely did I yield and show them what I had in the said hampers, when, with
an insatiable desire they began to covet all, the act of touching and the desire
to take everything becoming uppermost with them, rather than the modest civility
of asking for it....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Renew their March</b>. &quot;With great demonstrations of
love they loaded themselves with all our goods and supplies (except the sacred robes,
since we did not bring them till we knew that the outcome was safe) without giving
an opportunity to any of the singers whom we had brought with us to carry anything.
With this accompanying we set out on the road which leads in the direction of the
East, for Peten Ytza, which is about five leagues off, all the Indians who lived
round Cha Kan Ytza accompanying us with their wives and children, giving shouts
of joy in order to excite the rest to accompany us.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Nich</b>. &quot;We went on in this manner to the landing place of the
lake where one enters the said Peten Ytza, on the shore of which is found a little
town called Nich, which consists of about ten houses. In one of them I saw an Indian,
the oldest one I had seen up to that time in the nation of the Cehaches, nor up
to the present time in that of the Ytzaes, since they have the custom of beheading
them when they pass fifty years, so that they shall not learn to be wizards and
to kill; except the priests of their idols, for whom they have great respect. And
this man must have been one without doubt.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In the region of the said road, there
are many hills and great density of woods on the hills, many cedar and mahogany
trees, which in this tongue are called <i>punabes</i>, besides many others which I do
not mention so as to avoid annoyance. There are many overflowed places called <i>Akalchees</i>;
there are also three rivers, one of moderate size, which from its falling from a
high rock, makes noise enough; the other two, although they too fall from a rather
high place, are not so full of water, though they wet us all because their streams
are wide and because there is no bridge to cross them. We came then to the said
town, Nich, whose cacique is called Ahtul, and this little town is the chief town
of Cha Kan Ytza, which consists of other very small towns, but of many settlements,
and each of these possesses a cacique or captain, although all the Cha Kan Ytzaes,
with their wives and children, as far as I saw, will be about six hundred souls,
more or less.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Indians Arrive from Tayasal</b>. &quot;We ate very heartily in the said
town, for the sake of giving them pleasure, so that they showed that they were pleased
and they entertained us with their instruments from twelve o&#39;clock of the day that
we arrived till two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, when, in answer to the previous messenger
which I sent to the petty King of my coming to his territory, there came up some
eighty canoes, full of Indians, painted and dressed for war, with very large quivers
of arrows, though all were left in the canoes,--all the canoes escorting and accompanying
the petty King, who with about five hundred Indians came forward to receive us.
They hurried us on board with great speed and with very rude actions, without taking
notice of the music of the clarions with which we awaited him, nor of the peace,
which as its messengers I brought him in the name of the King, our Lord. Nor on
our part, could we fulfill our embassy, since, without giving us an opportunity
to do so, they began suddenly to take us across the lake (which in that part probably
is three leagues in distance across).<a name="div2Ref_9.2" href="#div2_9.2"><sup>9.2</sup></a> In a small bay on its shore, a nephew
of the King, whom I had rewarded with some Spanish trinkets, coveting the image
of a Santo Christo, which I wore on my neck, and which I had refused to give him
on two occasions when he had asked me for it, on my giving a cutlass with its blade
to the petty King, his uncle, seized the hand of his uncle with excessive insolence,
and snatching the blade from its sheath, turned it to my breast, and passing the
blade across my throat, cut the string with one blow and took the image of Christ
from me. I reproached him for his improper act and what he said to me was, &#39;Well,
if you have not wished to give it to me, what am I to do?&#39;, by which it is plainly
seen that if one does not give them what they see and ask for, the life of him who
should refuse it is at risk from moment to moment. On seeing this the King, his
uncle, laughed at it, instead of reproving him, and he began with more vanity and
pride than a Lucifer, to say to me many things very foreign to that first meeting.
By this insulting and hasty reception, they did not give us an opportunity to look
after our baggage, although the Chakan Ytzaes had the opportunity to put our things
under such good guard that up to now we had not seen it, we being left from that
time without more comfort than the clothes on our backs, nor more sustenance than
that which their savage generosity might choose to give us.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Bravery of Avendaño</b>. &quot;In the long time that we were on the
lake, a temptation was offered to the King, such as belonged to the devil who inspired
it and natural to his inhuman and cruel heart, so as to inspire me with fear, so
that my heart might suffer some sadness or disturbance; but his purpose found itself
frustrated, first, because when I started from Merida for this nation, I went prepared
to die; and second, knowing that they were such savages in their ways, my courage
stood prepared to suffer whatever insults they might say to me, as for instance
to bear for God, who gives us courage, any unreasonable acts, whatsoever. Suddenly
the said King placed his hand over my heart to see if it was at all agitated, and
at the same time he asked me if I was so. I who was before very glad to see that
my wishes and the work of my journey were being obtained, replied to him, &#39;Why should
my heart be disturbed? Rather it is very contented, seeing that I am the fortunate
man, who is fulfilling your own prophecies, by which you are to become Christians;
and this benefit will come to you by means of some bearded men from the East; who
by signs of their prophets,<a name="div2Ref_9.3" href="#div2_9.3"><sup>9.3</sup></a> were we ourselves, because we came many leagues
from the direction of the east, ploughing the seas, with no other purpose than,
borne by our love of their souls, to bring them, (at the cost of much work) to that
favor which the true God shows them.&#39; I at this time, with some freedom on my part,
also placed my hand on his breast and heart, and asking him also if his was disturbed,
he said, &#39;No.&#39; To which I replied, &#39;If you are not disturbed, at seeing me, who
am the minister of the true God, different in everything from you, in dress, customs
and color, so that I inspire fear in the devil, and if your heart is not troubled,
why should you expect me to be afraid of you, mere men like myself, whom I come
to seek purposely, with great pleasure, merely for the love which I have for their
souls, and having found them, in order to announce to them the law of the true God,
as you shall hear when we come to Peten.&#39; At this, changing the conversation, the
devil tried to use him as his instrument for putting me in another greater temptation.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;It is a custom among them, that, on the day before killing any one or sacrificing
him, especially if he is a stranger to their town, to give them something to eat,
either the hot drink of barley and beans, which they use, or another of <i>cacao</i>,
which is what they offer them. I was not ignorant of all these rites, through what
history relates that they had done on the two occasions on which priests of my holy
religion had gone there; although in one case did they kill the Padre Fray Diego
Delgado, through the fault of some Spaniards who followed him. When in the same
way the said King asked me if I was hungry, I, though I had just eaten, realizing
the situation, said &#39;Yes,&#39; so that his wickedness should not see any cowardice in
me; and I asked him if they had anything to eat, that they should give me some.
At once he ordered that all the canoes should halt, and made them give red peppers
and herbs, or <i>tamales</i>, which they brought on purpose to give us in the middle
of that lake. I ate it eagerly and asked him very pleasantly if there was any more;
to which he replied, &#39;Then it has tasted good to you?&#39; &#39;Finely,&#39; I told him, &#39;and
I would eat more if there were any.&#39; I said this to him with some wit, at which
they all laughed, but in a serious way, and they gave another which I ate with the
same pleasure, at which they were all surprised,--at the sight of my coolness....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Landing at Tayasal; the Idol</b>. &quot;With this we continued our
way to Peten Ytza, which is situated in the middle of the said lake, as well as
in the midst also of other islands or <i>Petens</i>. On the shore of the landing place
is situated the house of the said petty King at the distance of half a quarter of
a league, in the middle of which, open to the street, stands the fragment of a column,
of round stone, the circumference of each part of which is about three quarters
of a yard across and one quarter high. It is made of stones placed on top of each
other with mortar of lime and <i>cah cab</i>, which is usually used for that purpose;
and the middle is filled in with bitumen, so that it is like a table, with a round
pedestal, upon which and set in the foundation of the said stone column, there stands
out toward the West a stone mask, very ill-formed, which, together with the stone
column, the petty King and the rest of his family and followers worship. The said
column is called, in the name by which they worship it, Yax cheel cab, which means
in their language, &#39;the first tree in the world,&#39; and, as is understood in their
old songs (which few people understand) they wish to have it known they worship
it because it was the tree of whose fruit our first father Adam ate, who in their
language is called Ixanom. In the small part which is fortunately preserved, and
the mask, which stands in the said foundation of the said column, they worship him
with the title of the son of the very wise God. In their language they call him
Ahcocahmut....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>At the Temple</b>. &quot;We came to the said temple which had more space
than the hall of the petty King, although it is the same in its structure. Here
we dimly saw a box suspended,<a name="div2Ref_9.4" href="#div2_9.4"><sup>9.4</sup></a> in which we saw indistinctly (although hastily)
a bone of the leg or thigh, very large in size, which appeared to be that of a horse;
and I confess that though we had much to do that afternoon, which was the time that
we stayed in that temple, we acted a little unwisely, since we neither asked what
that bone was, nor did we remember in the rest of the days to go and look at it
more deliberately. This thought occurred to us when we had left Peten, when our
error was irremediable (which was a cause of greater grief) because we remembered
then that that bone was by chance from the horse which Cortes left in their care,
which they had kept as a relic or to hold him in memory, since they rendered worship
(as I said before) to his statue.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Read the Letters</b>. &quot;At last I brought out the letters
of the message and it cost no little trouble to make them sit down and keep quiet,
so that they might hear it. I called before us all the priests, who are the Masters
of the law, and all the caciques, captains and chiefs of all the districts of that
island or <i>Peten</i>.... I began to read to them the message which the Governor sent
in writing in the name of the King our Lord; and in the few moments that I had read
to them, seeing their manner and the little attention which they showed, I perceived
that they did not understand what I was reading to them, and having asked them about
this, they replied in the words, &#39;<i>manucan a can tucot kanil caxicin</i>,&#39; which means,
&#39;we do not understand what you say.&#39; Then, leaving off reading the letter, ... I
explained the said message to them in the ancient idiom, and inserting a spiritual
sermon ... and all this was explained to them with some eagerness, mixing in some
words of their prophecies, which were at that time to the point. They heard it gladly,
because they understood it all.... They answered in these words, &#39;<i>cato vale</i>,&#39;
which is as if they said &#39;We will think of it first, for there is time for answering.
Wait.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Curiosity of the Itzas</b>. &quot;With this, as it was already almost
night-fall, we set out with the same crowd for another temple, which stands about
three-eighths of a league from the house of the petty King, where was our abode.
Although we stopped there, the continuation of their wonderment did not stop on
their part, since, with this as an excuse, they did not leave us a moment alone
by day or night, since if any, satisfied with having seen us by day, went away to
their houses at night, double the number of them came by night to see us and to
sleep there, besides those who came first, and even those who had gone away satisfied
with seeing us, did not fail to come back. In this way we lived with the annoyance
which can be imagined, since we were not able to attend to our needs, without their
following us; and neither the prohibition of the King nor our own scolding were
sufficient to hinder their excessive curiosity, the only attention which they paid
to either being that they all laughed at it. Their tediousness was such, that if
we sat down, they all sat down next to us, surrounding us; and then some on one
side and others on the other would touch us from top to toe, not excepting (if we
gave them the chance) the most hidden parts of a man; if we stopped or walked on,
it was all the same, so that, in order to be able to carry on the divine service
without that annoyance, we contrived the plan that they should seat themselves in
a row around the said temple on the benches of stone and lime which were there,
and we, walking up and down in the middle, carried on the divine service, it all
being a matter of amusement for them,--not only the movement of our lips speaking
things they did not understand, but also the gestures and crosses which we made
over ourselves as we prayed; and, although we got through with our prayers, we kept
walking all the while so as to enjoy the relief for so much longer time.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The King
was present at all this, since he never left us by day or night.... I asked them
what it was that they had decided to reply to my message. At which the King, taking
the lead, answered, for all, in the same words as above, &#39;<i>Cato cato vale</i>.&#39; &#39;We
will answer soon.&#39; And the King, speaking aside with me, asked what it was I wished
to hear; to which I replied, &#39;to know if you wish to receive the law of God and
the friendship of the Spaniards which I offered you yesterday, and if you wish to
undertake to be Christians, as has been prophesied to you by your prophets, since
you are not ignorant of them. The time has come.&#39; To which the King, together with
the two other priests who were with him, replied to me that they were willing to
become Christians, but that they did not know how that kind of baptism which I had
explained to them was to be carried out. Then I, taking as a text that verse of
Ezekiel, &#39;I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean; from all your
iniquities and your idols will I cleanse you,&#39; explained the said text to them,
item by item.... They replied to this in these words,--&#39;<i>ba valac a toca vale</i>,&#39;
which means &#39;so it will be when tomorrow dawns and we shall see it.&#39; With this we
all went to the temple, where we stopped and where they were present all night.
Before God brought the dawn, they had already caused to be brought some cups of
warm <i>posole</i>, which they are accustomed to drink, so that with this and the rest
of the supplies which they use, such as ..., beans, cooked squashes, flesh of wild
pigs, prawns and other kinds of fish, with whatever each man found in his house,
and all this with many tortillas of maize bread, and they did not stop bringing
these till night; there being an excess of everything, so that when we saw that
these same people did not depart from here, we gave it back again to them to eat,
which they did, the King beginning first.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>A Baptism Performed</b>. &quot;Having breakfasted this first day on
warm <i>posole</i>, we began for the third time to speak about the spiritual lecture
of the day before, ... and having heard for the third time this lecture, anxious
to receive the said baptism, although suspicious of what it was, since they thought
that there was some shedding of blood or circumcision or cutting of some part of
their body, they said that they wished to see in one case how that was done, and
at this time the King, taking hold of one child of the many of his family which
he had concealed behind the temple for the said purpose, said to me,--&#39;Do that which
you speak of to this child and I will see whether it is good or not.&#39; To which I
replied,--&#39;And if it should seem to be good, will you permit me to do just the same
with the rest of your children?&#39; To which the King replied, before all the people
who stood around listening, that he would. Then taking the child which the King
offered me, and one of the Indian singers who went with us holding him, I sprinkled
on him the baptismal water. Then, seeing that this was such an easy thing and without
the harm which they had expected, they asked me to do the same with the children
which the King had concealed there. These he immediately brought forth, and he bade
all those present (especially those of his family and district) to bring their little
children to receive their names (for this is what they called baptism). And he told
the priests who were present there, about three or four in number,--&#39;It is proper
that all your children should come to receive their names and to be washed.&#39; With
this example of the King in being the first to bring his children to be baptized,
the other Indians imitated him in bringing theirs in great haste, so that in the
three days and a half during which they delayed in giving their answer to my message,
I performed very nearly three hundred baptisms, without my having an opportunity
to stir from that temple, on account of my seeing the assemblage of Indian men and
women, who brought their children of their own accord to be baptized. I gladly administered
the said holy rite, since the King, (who in everything showed himself very friendly
towards me) and three other priests who were his relatives had told me that they
were only waiting for two caciques with their captains, in order to give the final
answer, which would be favorable in all respects (as they did give it) and this
will be seen below....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;I stopped baptizing until I could catechize them in the
mysteries of our holy faith, which is required for such a purpose; and afterwards
all agreed with me to receive baptism when I should come back there at the appointed
time of four months hence, as I will speak of in the proper place.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Other Caciques Arrive</b>. &quot;I found myself occupied in this work,
when, on the said day, there began to come, sailing over the lake, some of the governors&#39;
captains and head men of the four other <i>Petens</i> or islands, with their officers
of war, and their paraphernalia, such as javelins and their flint daggers, a little
less than a quarter of a yard long,--the said javelins adorned with feathers of
various colors instead of with ribbons, very beautiful to see, and all hanging down.
I went forth to receive them, out of the courtesy which is due from me, but the
Indians of that <i>Peten</i> went out stirred merely with curiosity to see them come,
painted red and covered with feathers, with their war trappings and their faces
painted black. I embraced them and spoke to them in kind words, and if I found that
I had anything left to eat, of what they gave me there, I shared it with them, as
they had just come, making them sit down next to me and the King, who always remained
at my side. As the result of my action, if they had any misgiving, they cast it
aside, or if they felt any anger or dissatisfaction on seeing me there, they became
calm, and at once I set forth my proposal, which they accepted and received well,
which proposal was that they should be friends of the Spaniards and should receive
their laws, in proof of which acceptance they bowed their heads, saying that they
wish the trade in hatchets and machetes which they should receive from them.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Caciques in War Paint</b>. &quot;Among these caciques or governors
of the said four islands, there came an old man with a moderate sized <i>machete</i>
with two edges, forming the blade of his javelin; and another, not so old, with
his flint dagger; and these, besides coming painted and in warlike array, had their
faces as foul as the purpose which they had in their hearts was wicked (as they
promptly showed). Looking at them naturally inspired horror. I did my best to treat
them more kindly, speaking to them more frequently and pleasantly, discoursing with
them in their ancient idiom, as if the time had already come (just as their prophets
had foretold) for our eating together from one plate and drinking from one cup,
we, the Spaniards, making ourselves one with them. To this the older one replied,
with an affected laugh, that he was very happy at this, so as to go from these thickets
in which he lived and to come with me to the Province and obtain titles to lands
which his ancestors held and to live on these in happiness among his elder brothers,
the Spaniards; promising me at the same time to accompany me with all his people
into the presence of the Governor as a proof of a true surrender. His showing without
necessity such submission was a sure sign of his real treachery. It was now about
four o&#39;clock in the afternoon without their having had speech with the King, at
which they went at once to the house of a friend of theirs, and I saw that the King
took little account of them, and it was because, as I knew afterwards from the mouth
of the King, they were his enemies....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Avendaño Makes Inquiries as to their Manner of Reckoning Time</b>.
&quot;I told them that I wished to speak to them of the old manner of reckoning which
they use, both of days, months and years and of the ages, and to find out what age
the present one might be (since for them one age consists only of twenty years)
and what prophecy there was about the said year and age; for it is all recorded
in certain books of a quarter of a yard high and about five fingers broad, made
of the bark of trees, folded from one side to the other like screens; each leaf
of the thickness of a Mexican <i>Real</i> of eight. These are painted on both sides with
a variety of figures and characters (of the same kind as the Mexican Indians also
used in their old times), which show not only the count of the said days, months
and years, but also the ages and prophecies which their idols and images announced
to them, or, to speak more accurately, the devil by means of the worship which they
pay to him in the form of some stones. These ages are thirteen in number; each age
has its separate idol and its priest, with a separate prophecy of its events. These
thirteen ages are divided into thirteen parts, which divide this kingdom of Yucathan
and each age, with its idol, priest and prophecy, rules in one of these thirteen
parts of this land, according as they have divided it; I do not give the names of
the idols, priests or parts of the land, so as not to cause trouble, although I
have made a treatise<a name="div2Ref_9.5" href="#div2_9.5"><sup>9.5</sup></a> on these old counts with all their differences and explanations,
so that they may be evident to all, and the curious may learn them, for, if we do
not understand them, I affirm that the Indians can betray us face to face.&quot;<a name="div2Ref_9.6" href="#div2_9.6"><sup>9.6</sup></a></p>
<p class="normal"><b>Avendaño Explains the Prophecies</b>. &quot;The said cacique pretended
ignorance, answering me that he did not understand these computations, but I, in
case what he said was true, in order that he might understand them, explained them
very minutely; and in order that he, if he did understand them, should not twist
their meaning (as they are accustomed to do) with some of their superstitions, undertook
with much pleasure the work of sitting down at length with them, the King having
come at this time, (for he is the chief priest and master of them) with other priests
and leaders who were there, before all of whom I carried on the said work, with
the greatest pleasure and earnestness, so that there we might discuss in the sight
of all, how the time had already expired (according to their prophets) in which
they should begin to become Christians. I also made a computation of these accounts
(the King and some of the priests aiding with their opinion) so that, confessing
that they were convinced, we agreed that four months thereafter was the time wanting
to fill out the said period when all the older men would receive baptism.... And
so (they said) that this was the reply which they gave to my message, with which
I could go back to the Governor who sent me, until the said four months had passed.
At the end of which time they expected me, in order to carry out the agreement we
had made, notifying me that I should not come back by Cha Kan Ytza, through which
I had come there, since those Indians were their enemies and might kill me, but
that I should go by Tipu (the road through which lies in the opposite direction)
where he [Canek], knowing that I had arrived would come forward with all his people
to receive me, informing me that from the Peten Ytza (which is the court of the
said King) to Tipu, which they told me about, there were twelve days of travel,
by which they left me to understand the love with which they received my message
and the pleasure and good will which they had in becoming Christians.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Objection of Covoh</b>. &quot;The devil, envious of the results which
were being gained and which would be gained by their and my fulfilling the agreement
which I had made to return there in the said four months, without putting himself
forward, took possession<a name="div2Ref_9.7" href="#div2_9.7"><sup>9.7</sup></a> anew of the heart of that old cacique called Covoh,
as he did with the heart of Judas. As Covoh found himself among his enemies (as
are the King and the larger part of Peten) and seeing that that which his wicked
heart intended was contrary to the agreement made in his presence, therefore he,
as did the rest of the caciques and captains, said they were convinced; notwithstanding
what had been said, the said Cacique Covoh burst forth in great anger in the following
words:--&#39;What matters it that the time has come when we are to become Christians,
if this slender point of my flint lance has not been worn out?&#39; To this I answered
him with the special favor and the special courage of God, &#39;You must know, Cacique
Covoh, that he who permits me to come and argue with you (who is the true God of
the Heavens) alone can give you this pleasure, if, for his greater glory, he allows
me to die; and if he does not allow it, in vain do you show this arrogance of yours,
since, just as there is a time marked out and determined for you to become Christians,
so also are the times determined for me to die for love of him; and if it were left
in your hands, as you think, and say such things, you would have carried it out,
or the devil Pakoc (this is an idol who speaks to them very frequently) whom you
adore and who dictates such things to you; but here you shall know how slight is
his strength in my presence, since he only dares to speak of it to you and not to
come and execute it upon me. And I do not know (notwithstanding the great arrogance
you show) what victory there can be in so many of your armed men here, killing so
unjustly and without notice a few men like us, who, moved solely by love of you,
intend without any arms, but for your own good, to take you out of the slavery in
which you stand. In short here I am; I know not what prevents you from carrying
out what you say.&#39; With this, since it was late at night, they withdrew, and I with
the King and the rest of the priests remained discussing the agreement which we
had made.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Discussion with Canek and Others</b>. &quot;On the next day, after performing
baptisms on some who came to me, talking with the King and some of the caciques
of the other <i>Petens</i> or islands and other priests, who stayed with us continually,
we discussed at our leisure various matters which came up. I asked them what products
they had for their food and clothing, and they told me that they had a great deal
of maize, beans, seeds, peppers, and that they sowed all this two or three times
in the year; also many plantains and <i>chunes</i>, which are like the <i>chayotes</i>, though
without thorns; some <i>cacao</i> (though but little), vanilla, and in some orchards
enclosed with stakes in their homes, some wild cabbage. I did not see these nor
the onions, which, however, the singers who accompanied me told me that they had
seen;<a name="div2Ref_9.8" href="#div2_9.8"><sup>9.8</sup></a> there is a great deal of cotton, cochineal, and indigo, which accounts
for the abundance of clothing which they have and give to the Cehaches Indians,
and those from Tipu in barter for hatchets and <i>machetes</i>; and all this woven very
neatly, in a variety of colors of cotton thread; the said clothing is very durable,
since it is like felt, although the colors of their cloth are not very permanent,
from their not knowing; how to give it the finishing touch....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Friendliness of Canek</b>. &quot;Because from the time that I had convinced
them by their own ancient computations,--a thing that they considered impossible
for any other man except their priests to learn,--they began to love and fear me
at the same time; saying that I was undoubtedly a great personage in the service
of my Gods, since I had succeeded in learning the language of their ancestors and
their own, for from no one else of all these neighboring natives had they heard
it, nor did they have any information that the Spaniards who subjugated their lands
knew it.... On which account they called me Chomachahan, which means among them,
&#39;Great Lord, worthy of reverence,&#39; and Citcaan, which means &#39;Father of Heaven.&#39;
...&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Demonstrations against Canek</b>. &quot;Suddenly a disturbance arose
without any cause, among the crowd of Indians, together with their head men and
captains and some priests, in which in my presence they said to the King many discourteous
things, after which they went on to say,--&#39;What good was the friendship of the Spaniards
and their law to be to them? If it was to get hatchets and <i>machetes</i> for cultivating,
means had never failed them to till their soil up to that time; if it was for the
stuffs and cloths of Castile for clothing them, when did they need any of this,
since theirs was very good; if it was that the Spaniards should defend them, when
was the Ytzalana nation cowardly or when did it humiliate itself to any one, since
they had so many warriors for their own defense and for the destruction of as many
as ventured against them? It was a very bad thing to receive them.&#39; The King also
opposed them in my presence with wisdom enough, defending in every point what they
and he had agreed on with me; and with more severity reproved the arrogant mention
of arms, in that they had said it before me. They grew more disturbed with the reproof
and the contestants increased, and many, who up to that time had not spoken, then
declared themselves as opposed to him, all the said men bursting out against him
with words of great anger and exceeding boldness; all this discord was caused by
the said Cacique Covoh, who had not yet gone to his own town. I, who was paying
attention to everything, seeing that all that great crowd was already excited and
not paying attention to one another, since all were talking at the same time, rising
by the side of the King and standing in the midst of them, said to them with some
anger and effect:--&#39;What is this? What disturbance and tumult is this, so entirely
without foundation? Is it by chance because you have made an agreement with me to
accept the friendship of the Spaniards and to trade with them in peace and kindness?
Well then, what dagger did I press against your breast in order to make these friendships
and to agree upon this peace with you, other than the good-will with which you have
joined hands with me, knowing that already the time has come for you and the Spaniards
to eat together in one plate and to drink together from one cup in token that you
are our brothers? It is without doubt because you have remembered at this moment
that you Indians are fickle in everything. Go, shame on you, and remember that you
are Ytzalanos, respected by everyone as people of intelligence and consideration.
Bear in mind that the agreement which you have made with me to be friends of the
Spaniards is an intelligent act, by which you show that you are not ignorant of
your prophecies, and your executing it will do you much honor, since our King and
Lord is the greatest monarch that is found today in the world, to whom not only
a few poor men isolated as you are, but very extensive kingdoms and empires consider
themselves very fortunate in rendering and paying homage to him. And besides, notice
how your great Montezuma, as soon as they informed him that my King was such a great
Lord and that his empire was so extensive, offered him not only his crown, but also
his person and kingdom, going as he did personally to offer it to him.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Leniency Promised by the Padres</b>. &quot;&#39;But the Governor, who sends
me, does not intend to take anything from you nor from the King any part of his
command, but instead, he wishes that all this should remain with him, as is evident
from this clothing which I have placed upon him and by that <i>baton</i> which I have
placed in his hand. This among the Spaniards is a sign of command and rule.... All
this being so, why do you raise this disturbance? Go, Ytzalanos, be ashamed of yourselves,
since the agreement which you and your King have made with me is a very good one.&#39;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;With this I sat down again and they stood still without knowing what had happened
to them; and changing at once the conversation they indulged in much noisy mirth
and laughter, playing jokes on each other, without thinking of the passed disturbance,
as if it had not happened....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Avendaño Takes Steps to Protect the Itzas from Further Molestation</b>.
&quot;Suspecting that in my absence some Spaniards might come either from this Province
or that of Guatemala to make war on them, from their being around there in opening
the road, they therefore asked me, in order to calm their hearts and as a token
of peace, to give them some sure signs or well understood token, so that (in case
any Spaniards should come to their lands from this Province of Yucathan or from
the other one of Guatemala) they should do them no harm nor make war on them, when
they showed them the said sign and well known token, which I should leave them.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Letter of Counsel</b>. &quot;Then I left them the following letter:--</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Captains of whichever of the two Poles, North or South. My dear Lords. Our Lord
was pleased to communicate to us his divine favor, in order to succeed in obtaining
that which for many ages no one has been able to obtain. (But nothing is impossible
to the divine power, to whom may the glory be ascribed.) Because for his glory he
has given opportunity to humble the neck of this unconquerable Ytzalana nation,
humbling itself at the first suggestion of the ministers of the gospel, and sons
of my holy Padre, San Francisco, by promptly offering their children to the most
pure washing of baptism, I having baptized up to this time many of them, with the
sure hope of baptizing them all in a short time; though the fathers and mothers,
although gentle and peaceable with us, are nevertheless slow in giving up their
idolatry; and for this reason especially it is necessary to show moderation with
great patience, so as to bear many such vexing acts as are due to the darkness in
which they have lived; on this account I beg your Graces to act with much prudence
(if by chance you should come to this nation of the Ytzaes, whose patron is Saint
Paul) so as not to lose in a short time what is so much desired and has been attained,
thanks be to God! They are inclined to receive you in peace when your Graces appear
and to give you what supplies, etc., that may be needed by you, in barter for hatchets,
<i>machetes</i> and other merchandise of Castile, which they wish for exceedingly, but
I do not know whether you will be well paid. This is as much as occurs to me now.
After expressing my joy for the good health of your Graces, to whose service I offer
humbly my own health, asking our Lord to keep you many years, as I wish. In the
Town of Great Saint Paul of Peten Ytza, on the sixteenth of January, 1696. I kiss
the hand of your Graces. Your most humble servant and chaplain,--Fray Andrés de
Avendaño, Apostolic Missionary Commissioner....&quot; There follows the certification
of this letter by the Apostolic Notary.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;... With this I delivered the letter to
the King in the presence of many chiefs and the greater part of the common people,
so that all were satisfied with such an agreement, and agreeing moreover, they with
me and I with them, that within the said four months, I should come back to see
them.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Before Leaving Tayasal, Avendaño Shames Covoh</b>. &quot;Finding ourselves
now very near our departure, I notice how, after the last disturbance above referred
to, although it is true that the sermon that I preached to them calmed their spirits,
nevertheless the devil did not fail to sow tares in the hearts of the Cacique Covoh,
whom I have spoken of many times, and in another cacique named Ahcan, a relation
of the King of Peten, and in the Captain Covoh, with all his followers, all of whom
are Cha Kan Ytzaes, noting here that the first settlement which I met with on my
entering the land of the said Cha Kan Ytzaes, was that of the said Cacique Ahcan
and his Captain Covoh, to whom I showed (as I said at the beginning of my said entrance)
what I was bringing for the King of Peten Itza; and these were the men who took
away from us all that we carried at the time of our embarking on the lake. These
men I did not fail to put to shame in Peten, before the King and the rest of the
chiefs, not complaining of what they had taken from us, from the poor supply of
the priests and of the four Indian singers, who carried their change of clothes
with them, but my regret was that they had stolen the entire suit of clothes, with
its <i>sombrero</i> and <i>baton</i> which the Governor had given me to give to the King in
his name. This I scolded them for in earnest, asking them: &#39;What sort of way that
was to receive a messenger, taking away from him all that he had brought, instead
of giving a very kind reception?&#39; This, with other effective reasons, I repeated
on various occasions, until the clothes appeared, so that I myself clothed the King
with them.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Hatred of the Chakan Itzas for the Padres Increases</b>. &quot;The
said Chakanytzaes then, abashed that the said clothes had been found in their possession,
conceived a hatred against me.... They made a plan among themselves to kill us,
when we passed through their territories, without the King and the others in Peten
knowing it. On account of this, the said Cacique Can came with his Captain Covoh,
with a great gourd full of <i>posole</i>, and with it entering the house of the King,
in which. I was at the time stopping, he told me to drink what he had brought me.
I drank it without suspicion, for always had I trusted in that text of the Evangelist
&#39;<i>si morfirum quid biberibit, non eis nosevit</i>.&#39; And scarcely had I drank it, when
they told me that they had come to ask me for two of the four Indians whom I brought
with me, who were the fattest, so that the next day when I should pass by their
house on my return, they should have made me something good to eat; for the Indians
would know how to prepare food for us in the way to which we were accustomed. I,
who recognized the wicked intention of the said invitation, said to them, &#39;I cannot
go without them, nor can they stay here without me. When I go, they will go.&#39; Then
they replied, &#39;Tomorrow, when the sun is up, we will all come for you, to accompany
you as we accompanied you hither.&#39; &#39;Well and good,&#39; I answered them. With this they
went off to their town very well satisfied, to prepare, without doubt, the <i>pib</i>
or fire where the two fat Indians, whom they asked me for, were to be cooked, and
the stakes on which we were to be spitted, as we found out later.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Canek Helps the Padres to Escape</b>. &quot;As soon as these men had
gone, the King said to me,--&#39;You have done well in not giving them your servants,
nor is it best for you to go back by their house nor by the road by which you came,
but by the opposite road, which is that of Tipu, to which place I will accompany
you; since you must know that this invitation is to kill you, in order that the
Spaniards may not know the road by which you came. And they say that they are going
to follow the Cehaches Indians who guided you, as far as their houses in order to
kill them; and so you must go tonight and when they come tomorrow they will find
that they have been tricked.&#39; The Queen and her daughters confirmed the truth of
this, for, when the time came to embark, they said to us, &#39;They say that they are
not going to kill you in any other way than by cutting you in little pieces,&#39; and
they made gestures with one hand over the other, to show that they were going to
make mince meat of us and eat us. We started that night, as I have said, and I will
tell about it more fully farther on. So that, when they came for me, they found
themselves tricked.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In a rage at seeing their purposes frustrated, the said Cacique
Can and his Captain Covoh and the other Cacique Covoh returned to their homes with
sixty Indian warriors of their followers.... The said Chakanytzaes Indians came
painted red and ready for war to the camp of the General Alonso Garcia de Paredes,
saying that I had sent them for the ornaments and the rest of the baggage which
I had left in the deserted town of Chuntucí, a land adjoining the nation of the
Cehaches, and that they came for the Padre who was taking care of these things....
On their saying to the General that they came for the ornaments, being sent by me,
the said General said to them, &#39;Nor does his servant come with you?&#39; &#39;Neither does
he come,&#39; they replied, &#39;so he merely sends us in this way.&#39; Then he brought out
wine to give them and sent them with the Padre Apostolic Notary to the said town
of Chuntucí, which was distant some few leagues from the camp, that he might deliver
to them the baggage and sacred vessels.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Paredes&#39; Stupidity; the Plot of the Chakan Itzas</b>. &quot;Cursed be
the ignorance which causes so great losses in this way! Of how great importance
is knowledge and experience for the proper despatch of things! This General has
no more knowledge or experience, except for cutting wild trees in the forest where
he has always been placed, cutting timber for building the ships which sail from
the port of Campeche. And so he missed at the present time the greatest victory
which could be gained in this kingdom of Yucatan.... Is it possible that reason
did not tell him, even if he was ignorant of the said points and of the military
laws, that a priest and minister of God was not going to send sixty Indians for
the sacred vessels and the Padre who guarded them, without sending him a message
in writing (as I promised to do when I took my leave) or without writing to the
said Padre my companion to come with them? Is it possible that, on seeing that neither
had I sent even one of the four Indians who accompanied me, even if I was not able
to write, so that they could deliver the sacred things to him, he was not surprised
enough to infer from that, either that what the sixty Indians said was false, or
that they had killed us,--especially as he saw them come painted red and in warlike
array and had entered impudently into the camp? Spare me from such an act, for in
this case (although I do not understand military laws) reason dictates that he ought
to have imprisoned them and disarmed them until he had satisfied himself whether
what they said was true, taking two of them as guides, and sending an officer with
the necessary people behind them, to investigate the truth of what had happened,
and according to the result, to act in the following way,--if it was true that I
sent them without a letter or sure token, he should have laid the blame on me and
should have honored the prisoners by accompanying them with all his people to take
possession of their lands in the name of the King our Lord, since then he would
know that this was the sign which I gave him when I took my leave of him, that the
said Ytzaes wished to become Christians and accepted the friendship of the Spaniards;
and if it was not true, he should then have made use of severity and the military
laws. For, if the story that I sent them was false, as it was, and if he had used
military severity with their three principal chiefs, who were the Cacique Covoh
and the Cacique Can and the Captain Covoh, all of whom the King of Peten, in his
answer to the message, told me were his enemies, and said that if the Governor executed
them, he (the King) would deliver over all the <i>Petens</i>, then all the nations of
the Ytzaes would have been conquered and delivered to the King our Lord, and at
this moment they would all have been Christians without the said victory costing
a shot of powder.... And he ought not to have allowed them to go behind the said
Padre, my companion, some leagues away, with the risk that the said heathen might
kill the priest without the merit of being in the service of God; and with the risk
of their stealing and misusing the sacred vessels.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Chakan Itzas are Foiled by God</b>. &quot;But God, who looks after
his affairs, arranged that on the said Chakanytzaes coming near the ornaments, they,
pretending a need, told the Padre to await them there, and they went into the woods
and went to their town without having accomplished any of the many purposes for
which they came; the first, to see if they had got ahead of me and my companions
(understanding that we had passed through their territories by night) so as to carry
out their intention of killing us; the second, to see if they could catch the three
Cehaches Indians, our guides, who returned to their homes by that road, so as to
kill them; the third to see how many Spanish people were in the camp for working
on the road which they were opening, so as to flee if they were many and to resist
them if they were few; the fourth to satisfy their greed by stealing the sacred
vessels with the rest of the wares of Castile which they thought I brought with
me. But they found it all in vain, thanks be given to God, who thus looked after
his priests and the materials for celebrating mass; and not to the inconsiderate
action of the said principal head, by which he showed so little regard for looking
after the things of God and his ministers; but thus God has brought out all things
well, according to the purposes for which he has worked....&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Departure of the Padres from Tayasal</b>. &quot;Let us turn from
this digression to the departure from Peten. In order to frustrate the pretended
invitation which the Chakanytzaes gave us, we left with grief and tears enough on
the part of the family of the King and his friends, at about nine o&#39;clock at night
in the company of the King, his son and his son-in-law,--all three rowing in the
canoe at a good speed. We came to the other part of the lake in the direction of
the East, which is the road to Tipu, at between three and four o&#39;clock of the next
morning. When we landed here, on renewing our signs of affection with the King and
he with us, he again recalled to me the past agreement, saying &#39;See that you do
not forget to tell your Governor that I love him much and wish to be his friend
and that of the Spaniards, and not to fail to kill my said rivals, the Chakanytzaes,
for I am sure that I shall deliver to him the <i>Petens</i> which I rule. And do not
fail to come to see us, as you say, and let it be by this road of Tipu, so that
I with all my people may come out to receive you.&#39; All these words did the King
say to me, holding me in a loving embrace.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;He remained alone on the canoe to return
before they should miss him, and to us he gave his son and son-in-law as guides,
with their bows and arrows to defend us from anyone who might wish to do us harm.
They guided us through some very large plains or meadows, though afterwards there
were some very good bits of hills, with some bad stretches of mud and water, and
larger hills, so that, considering that it rained every day, wetting us very thoroughly,
since we did not have any place or wherewithal to shelter us, the journey was the
more troublesome and dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Avendaño Goes Eastward to Yalain</b>. &quot;In this way we came to the
first settlement of Peten Ytza, on the main land, in an easterly direction, which
is called Yalain, which is distant from Peten Ytza to that place, ten very long
leagues,--six on the water and four on land up to said town. This town consists
of very few houses close together, but also of many farms well peopled, at a distance
in a circle of one or two leagues. All are Indians of Peten Ytza, who came there
to farm, although there are also some from Tipu, and all are dwellers in the said
town, in which are found many Indians called Canekes, like the King of Peten, but
they are not relations of his, but are natives of his district, which (as I have
said) take their names from those who rule the said districts, although they may
have, as they do, their own surnames, each one from the father and mother. A priest
more than fifty-four years old, according to his appearance, called Chomachculu,
rules this town, a great comrade and confidant of the King Canek, to whom the said
King sent us, well recommended, so that he might give us as good reception and attention
as he would to himself. And this they did, for, as soon as we came, they gave us
very good things to eat and took us to a new house, which was only thatched, but
they had not put down the floor. This house, they told us was for us, ... and (they
told us) how in the month of September of the past year of ninety-five, there had
gone to Merida, four Indians who said that they were from Tipu, with whom I had
intercourse, and I gave them something to eat in our cell.... I heard that the said
Indians asked for ministers of the gospel so that they should administer to them
the divine word and the holy sacraments.... So when we came to this town of Yalain,
its inhabitants began to ask us about these four Indians who went to Merida in the
said month of September, (who had not yet come back).... In reply I asked them if
the men were one Achan with his younger brother, and another called Ahtec, and another
Anu, and they said &#39;Yes.&#39; To this I replied that I did not know why they had not
come to their town, as they had started so long before I did.... We stopped in that
town two days, its inhabitants treating us very well. From there they were to give
us a guide to pass on to Tipu, as the priest Chomachculu promised us in compliance
with the request which the King of Peten made of him, and on this supposition the
son and son-in-law of the King, who had guided us up to that time, returned home.
But they said that this guide was to be an Indian of Tipu, who came to Peten while
we were there, and, though the said Indian saw us leave Peten, he never came at
all, but rather stayed there.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Trouble with Soldiers</b>. &quot;We were staying on in hopes that this
man would come, when we saw coming six or eight Indians from Peten, who (as they
told us) were coming to their farms. These brought the news that there had been
a disturbance in Peten, on account of there having come in the part where we had
entered Indians from this side of the Province, and that they had heard musket shots,
with a rumor of Spaniards. I do not know if this was true, but what we experienced
from this time on from the Indians of that town where we were staying was that they
cooled off entirely in that affection with which up to that time they had regarded
us, showing us a thousand slights without paying any attention to giving us the
guide which we asked for. The change in their hearts came to such an extreme that
they called a meeting (drinking a great deal of their drink, with which not only
they get drunk, as they were then, but with which they worship). We came then to
a time when on that night the taking of our lives had been determined on, had not
God wished that I should learn about the matter; and so I taking from them the implements
of their feast, and reproving them for the little firmness of their hearts, they
came to understand that we knew the wickedness of their actions. Then they all gathered
together around us, and without any more noise or disturbance, they kept us company
all night. Scarcely had the dawn come when (perhaps in remorse for their sin) they
began to treat us with the same affection as at the beginning and to give us an
Indian who guided us to the other farms, half a league from there, which, from the
abundance of the fruit, appeared an orchard. There was another priest called Chomach
punab, who received us with very great kindness, giving orders to call all the Indians,
men and women, in the vicinity, so that they might see us, and asking us to stop
and have something to eat. We yielded to his importunity in order, by showing ourselves
pleased, to reciprocate so much kindness as they showed us. The wife of one of the
four Indians who I said before came to Merida, named Ahtec, spoke to me. Hardly
had we accepted the invitation, when all the Indian women went to their houses,
to make something for us to eat; and in a short time they came back, each one of
them with her bowl of meat, according to what they had, with many <i>tortillas</i>, so
that we, with the Indians who accompanied us, should eat; the Indians promising
us that some of them would accompany us. And, scarcely had we eaten and told them
to come to guide us, when suddenly they turned back, without our being able to get
anything from them, except that an Indian came about half a mile, to set us upon
that obscure path, which led towards the direction of Tipu, telling us that up to
that place, we had to speed on the way twelve days, from sunrise to sunset; and
that, two leagues before that, we should come across a great river, which we had
to pass, but he did not tell us how nor where.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Padres Suffer Hardships and Lose their Way</b>. &quot;With this
he returned to his house and we went on with twenty maize tortillas which we had
kept, of those which they had brought us to eat. With these we sustained ourselves,
seven people of us, for five days, at the end of which we came across a great river,
having before this met with many and very large <i>aguadas</i> and having passed many
ridges and hills, with so many other evident dangers that some fatality might happen
to us. Notwithstanding this, we took some pleasure at having found this great river,--first,
because we thought that we had not lost ourselves, since we had found the river
with signs which they gave us; and second, because we found ourselves (as it appeared
to us) near Tipu, where we could remedy the want of supplies from which we were
suffering. But our pleasure was marred, since, following the footsteps or obscure
path, along the banks of this river, on the fifth day of our following them, and
on the tenth day of the want of supplies from which we suffered, we found ourselves
entirely lost, in a greater perplexity than any human being could find himself;--that
is, surrounded on one side by the great full and broad river and surrounded on the
other sides by another multitude of little streams with great density of low trees,
so that it did not appear possible that we could pass through them; and on another
side were some cliffs and very high ridges so that we were not able, by making use
of the trees, to climb up the heights. In the midst of this struggle determined
to follow the direction to the Northwest, so as to reach the deserted town of Chanchanha,
and to cross the head streams of the great rivers and <i>aguadas</i> which surround it,
since in this direction it was not possible for us to fail in finding it. We went
three days in this direction, and from thinking that, if we missed the convent of
Chanchanha, in this direction, there was afterwards no place to have recourse to,
on account of the great distance that we were from a town on all sides, a great
sadness came over my companion Padres, so that they told me that we should change
our direction, since, if we did not, it was certain that we should perish in these
forests, and that the best thing was to try to strike the road which was being opened
from this Province to that of Guatemala, which runs from North to South. To please
them I yielded the opinion which I had determined on. From there we took the direction
to the West, although the distance in leagues and forests which we intended to traverse
was more than sixty or seventy. This distance was a great one, for us to be able,
breaking through such bad thickets and suffering from hunger for thirteen days,
to come through alive, without exaggeration.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Hard Travel in the Wilderness for Fifteen Days</b>. &quot;In those fifteen
days that we traveled in a northwesterly direction, we met with many <i>akalchees</i>,
or swamps, which consist of very bad passages through water and low and thorny shrubs
with a kind of square grass, which, if it caught our clothes, held us by the multitude
of thorns, which grow on the four corners from top to bottom; and if it caught our
face, hands or legs, it cut them like a small saw; so that as most of the woods
are <i>akalchees</i>, which consist of this grass, except on the high places, we were
always walking with our feet, hands or faces wounded, so that we did not know what
to do. Thus wounded, we went through some very long <i>akalchees</i>, when we directed
one of the Indians whom we brought, to climb a tree so as to look out and see where
we could make a short cut through the said <i>akalche</i>, for we were not able to suffer
any longer on account of the many sores which the said grass caused us. This said
Indian climbed the tree, and gave us the news that he had discovered a great meadow
or plain towards the northwest. Some instinct made me believe it, but to see whether
imagination and the wish we had to find it, had this effect, we took that direction,
so that in a little while we came upon the said meadow; but as we entered it, at
the beginning it had half a yard of water; we went ploughing through it and at each
step there was more water, and it took a long time to cross it, causing us pain
enough in our wounds. But with the care that we took not to get submerged, we forgot
that feeling, since the earth of the said marsh was so spongy that though we doubled
up the reeds which grew there in large number, so as to step over it, so that the
water might hold us up, yet if we stopped a moment, the overflowed earth drew and
sucked us in in such a way, that if we should fall, we could not help one another,
since he who should stop to help the other, would be submerged with him.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Miracle of the Bent Branch</b>. &quot;At the end of a long stretch of
this trouble, we reached some little woods, with trees of considerable height, which
were as much, or more, covered with water as what we had passed through. We passed
through these as well as we could, having in mind that that was now coming to an
end, when suddenly we came across a very large <i>aguada</i> of the kind they call Kaxek,
in which no bottom is found. Armed with patience, although with some trouble from
the fact that the sun was about to set, considering that we had to stay there that
night, I made an Indian climb one of the said trees, so as to see where the <i>aguada</i>
ended, or where we could make a short cut through the said <i>aguada</i>; and the said
Indian not discovering a passage in any part to our great sorrow, we, looking towards
one side, saw a branch of a tree broken, like those which the Indians break so as
not to lose themselves in the woods. We attributed this sign to a miracle, as it
was not probable that a human being could place that sign in that place. We followed
that sign in an easterly direction, which was that towards which the said branch
was bent, until, when, at a little distance, we came upon another branch bent in
the same way and very recently. At this we were consoled by the miracle which God
kept continuing. We went on with sticks in our hands, trying the shallow places,
because, when we least expected it, we came on many holes of alligators (since they
are found in abundance in the said overflowed woods) and then we were submerged
almost to our heads. We discovered a piece of level ground, about as large as the
ante-room of a cell, and thinking that it was solid, we started to pass over it,
but on its bearing the weight of the body, not only did all the ground shake, but
the part where we pressed on it, sinking, submerged us also with it; many alligators
starting from under it and fleeing from their holes, so that we went on with great
misgiving--one, so as not to sink in, the other, for fear that some of these alligators
would cut off a leg of ours at a mouthful. This was all a pure miracle, since there
also we came across the third branch close by a ridge, where we went to sleep that
night very well contented, although so wet, because God had freed us from that trouble
in which we were.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>An Uncomfortable Night</b>. &quot;We came out of that place about sunset,
and climbing the high ridge which we met with, we went to rest there, cold enough
from being drenched with water, even to the lint which we had for striking fire,
unable to get comfort by warming ourselves. We offered to God the trouble we had
passed and even with more fervor the trouble which follows from sleeping in wet
clothes. But remembering that the Indians are accustomed to make fire with two dry
sticks, and having no other than the staff which I carried, we broke it, and with
this God willed that we should obtain fire. We made a great fire, with which we
not only dried our garments and underclothes, but warmed ourselves very well. In
the vicinity of the fire we went to sleep.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;On the next day when we left this place,
we discovered a large plain or meadow, which horrified us just to see it, on account
of what had happened on the preceding afternoon, but as it was free from woods,
we were happy in passing over it, and more so as we had seen in the distance many
pine trees all about it, so that, thinking of their fruits, we had hopes of getting
something to eat; but our hope was in vain, since, when we came to see whether they
had cones, they had them, but without seeds. We had recourse to other trees, which
appeared to be evergreen oaks, with the acorns of which, if there were any, we might
give our bodies some sustenance; but they were nothing but oak trees which had nothing
but leaves. Crossing this field, we came upon a path well frequented by animals,
and as the grass was tall, their tracks were not seen; notwithstanding which, in
some marshes, where there was no grass and the soil was only damp, we saw that the
tracks were like those of an ox or bull. We wondered at this, from there not being
seen in a long distance from there any herd of cattle, so that for the time being
we suspended judgment.... But when in the Province I told this to people who go
through forests, they told me that those tracks were of deer, for there are such
in this Province. I offer no objection to there being as many wild animals as can
be imagined, since the woods are very well fitted for them.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Great Want of Food</b>. &quot;At the end of the said three days in which
we passed through these troubles, taking a westerly direction, we again began to
break through woods and with greater difficulty (than before), since hunger kept
wearing out our strength and the ridges which we met in the space of three days
were so high in all four directions, that it seemed impossible that men could cross
them, on account of the great height of their summits and the depth and shallowness
of their ravines. The trees of these hills of which we availed ourselves so as not
to fall, are some palms which are called <i>Cumes</i>, covered with thorns whose sharp
points are very long and cover the tree from top to bottom as far as the roots;
so that all our bodies were wounded by the said thorns from head to foot, particularly
our feet, since we went barefoot. At this time came the day of Purification of Our
Lady, when we prepared in spirit for celebrating that day, all of us confessing
one another, as men who at every moment had death before their eyes, on account
of the great want of food. And in order to obtain the holy indulgences of that day,
we had anticipated it by finding on the preceding days some date palms, with the
fruit in season, of which we made use for eating on those days, as well as some
<i>sapote mameys</i>, which, though they were as hard as stone, from their not being
in season, we cooked for eating.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Situation Grows Still Worse</b>. &quot;All this appeared to us now
very hard, to have to live only on these dates without any food. But in two or three
days after we found the dates and <i>sapotes</i>, the situation became more serious (and
much worse after many days); for not having found anything to eat for three days,
nor even to drink, as my mind turned more and more to spiritual things, since it
was not hindered by any bodily functions, which would prevent its reasoning powers,
so great was the occurrence of texts of scripture, examples of saints, and incidents
which it remembered, that I recalled very readily everything that I had read; so
that sometimes the said conditions brought about greater resignation to God, knowing
that it was then that he was of more assistance to his creature, when he purified
him more in the crucible of affliction; and at other times such memories served
as a greater encouragement; (although my resignation never failed). Then remembering
that there was no bird nor animal among the forest trees of which divine Providence
does not take care, as well in the adornment of clothing as in giving his daily
sustenance, and that to us, who were rational beings, created in his image and likeness,
the contrary happened, without our having, not only anything to eat, but not even
water to drink, this was an intellectual argument which we kept meditating on, as
we went along the road without stopping.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;But this meditation of mine beginning
to search the recesses of my conscience in my past life, scarcely had it come to
the threshold of this argument, when, knowing that its faults deserved much greater
punishment, it bore the present ones with patience and prepared itself for greater
ones in the future; but as the disordered appetite of this unrestrained body called
out each day for our daily food, remembering that God himself had taught us to ask
for it, though I knew that its not being found was a chastisement of my sins, not
on this account did I fail to continue the petition every day, particularly at the
hour when I knew that my brothers were eating in the refectories, with such pleasure
and tranquillity, without perhaps remembering us....</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;When the hour of noon was
passing, on which at the accustomed hour of eating we remembered said pleadings,
there passed also our desire for the said meal, considering that, since God did
not give it, it was not suitable for us, and thus that his most holy will should
be done in everything, and that if it was best for us to suffer more, his holy Majesty
sent it. Here the soul ruled, but it could not fail that the body also asked for
an offering which would preserve our lives, which it brought forward by continually
asking for it, as one who needed it so much. I then, leaning on the faith which
I had in my Father, San Diego, on the one side, and on the great need which I suffered
on the other, seeing that in reply to my prayers, San Diego had accomplished nothing
as it appeared to me, in my mind I directed the said Saint, in holy obedience, now
that my prayers were not accepted for my many sins, that he should go, moved by
his great charity, to the gates of Heaven to ask alms in the name of his brothers
who were lost in these parts and perishing from want,--an extraordinary thing truly.
A wonderful event which I relate for the greater confusion of me and my audacity
and for the greater glory of the humility and prompt obedience of my Father, San
Diego.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>They Find Some Miraculous Honey</b>. &quot;Scarcely had we gone twenty
steps from where I bade him for obedience sake, when we met with a sapote tree,
rotten and fallen on the ground, in which we found a bee-hive, and the occurrence
is the more wonderful in that, having no implement for cutting or taking out the
said bee-hive, other than the pike or point of my staff, the said trunk happened
to be rotten; so that with the said spike, we took the bee-hive out; besides the
fact that the tree had laid fallen for many years, the hive was freshly occupied,
so that there is no doubt that, while there were so many trees standing strong and
sound, they went to swarm in a trunk, rotten and fallen to the ground; so that it
is an evident miracle which my Glorious Father, San Diego, prepared for me. So when
we came across the bee-hive, with great tenderness and to my greater confusion,
I began to weep, confessing my sin to my companions, the Padres, which only my great
faith and the want from which we were suffering could excuse. We ate that honey
with its embryos and its excrement, without in our great hunger reserving any part
of it; and though the honey which fell to our share was not much, since there were
seven portions which were made of it, nevertheless it caused great thirst, as we
had brought no water with us, and did not find any for a long time afterwards. This
happened to us the day of the Purification of Our Lady, as I said before.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Two Padres Go Ahead</b>. &quot;On this day, it appearing to my two Padre
companions, either that hunger and want were lasting a long time, since fifteen
days of it were already passing or that we now found ourselves near the road which
we sought; guided as much by the law of nature which obliged them to save their
lives, as by the love with which they loved me, seeing also that I was overcome
as well by my needs as by the continual attacks of stomach troubles from which I
suffered, and that they, by being younger, could walk more leagues than the three
leagues which I walked each day, by which speed, if they reached safety first, not
only would they save their lives, but also would aid me with some assistance, so
that I should not perish in the woods, they said to me, &#39;Father our Commissioner,
we wish to go forward with the benediction and permission of your Reverence, to
see if we can make greater progress each day by some leagues, so as by this means
to reach some settlement, from which to send you some assistance, to aid your Reverence;
and if we should be delayed in getting out of the woods, and should meet with the
soldiers, we would send some of them whenever we met them, so that they may extricate
your Reverence and that you may not perish in these forests. We are of no importance,
and as such, we shall not be missed. But as for your Reverence, on whose shoulders
so much depends, such as giving an account to our Prelate and to our Lord the Governor
of everything that has happened, your loss would be of importance. Therefore we
beg your Reverence to give us your blessing in carrying out what has been said,
giving us one of these Indians to accompany us, and one of the two needles which
you have, so as to follow the direction to the west which we are taking.&#39; I, that
I might never be held responsible for any loss or harm that might come to them,
granted them the Indian they picked out, the needle, blessing and permission, although
I knew we were yet very far off from arriving in the four days that they thought.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;We took leave of each other with the mutual love and tenderness, which the loving
companionship of those who had followed me faithfully through so great hardships
required. We charged each other to remember one another in our poor and humble prayers.
With this they went off with the benediction of God and of myself, I remaining with
the three Indians, though one was dying (and he died later) and the rest with their
strength exhausted as mine was.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The departure of the Padres, my companions, and
my beginning to undergo new calamities, was all at the same time; for on those first
three days it was all passing through <i>akalchees</i>, or overflowed lands, although
they were dry but very much obstructed and closed up with low and thorny trees which
grew there, and with those cutting grasses which I spoke of above, so that we were
in constant trouble in passing through them, reopening once more all the wounds
which we had on our legs. And at that time we found ourselves with bare feet and
legs, and with our clothes in pieces, without getting any more comfort from them
than to cover myself with them at night; also a steel for striking fire, which by
a miracle we saved among the heathen Ytzaes, belonged to my companions, so that
they took it with them, and I remained without any human comfort, nor did they take
anything except the said steel.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>A Desperate Situation</b>. &quot;In this final and extreme need we remained
so absolutely destitute of everything, that only by some angel bringing us food
and placing it in our mouths, could we nourish this living body; because, even if
we should find anything, either animals or birds of the forest, we had nothing to
kill them with, and, even if they put themselves into our hands for killing, we
had no knife nor machete to skin them with, if they were animals, nor anything to
cook them with for want of a steel for striking fire. From this it can be inferred
that, being wet every day, at least with the dew, besides the showers which caught
us, and having to sleep on the bare earth, wherever night came upon us, whether
it was wet or dry, we were unable to get any comfort, besides not having any means
of making fire.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>They Find Some Edible Thistles</b>. &quot;Notwithstanding, the said
<i>akalchees</i> were not what exhausted us most, nor were they so unkind to us that
amongst them we did not find something to eat and drink; since on some trees there
were <i>Chuis</i>, which are like large edible thistles, the leaves of which preserve
the water from the dew and rains for a long time, and by tapping them in the stem,
the water which they have preserved comes out, although it is dirty and bad smelling;
but the thirst we felt was more so. These same plants served us for food, by eating
the stems of each leaf, something like two fingers of white that they have, since
that part is the most tender, and the rest is very bitter and hard. In the same
way we used to find in the said <i>akalchees</i> some roots of trees to gnaw, so that,
as the proverb says, &#39;Afflictions with bread are of less account,&#39; we did not feel
the sores which those cutting grasses had caused us, as I have said, in exchange
for what we found there of food and drink.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Some Hills are Reached</b>. &quot;These three days of <i>akalchees</i> having
passed, there followed three other days of hills and very high ridges, so that we
inevitably had to pass them, since they lay in all four directions. These followed
one after the other in such a way that, having finished climbing one, we went down
it again, without finding an eighth of a mile level below. Upon which we again ascended
the next one, for all of these were so high that their heights cannot be told except
to say that in their deep valleys the rays of the sun do not penetrate. So weak
did we become from ascending these hills on account of the fatigue, as well as by
going down, because of the stony ground, or for both reasons, it was necessary to
make use of the trees, which cover the hills, the most of which are the said palms
called <i>Cumes</i>, full of penetrating thorns, which injured our feet, hands and bodies,
since falling from weariness, we were wont to strike against them.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;On the top,
then, of one of these hills, we found a broad <i>aguada</i>,--a thing which surprised
us much, since there were not any other high places around it, from which the water
could come. There were there very many flint stones which caused injury enough to
our feet on account of our going barefoot. I do not know to what to attribute that
water on that high hill top, since in the preceding ravines, which, for the most
part, were rivers, although now dry, water was not found, except to a miracle, by
which God gave us to understand that he had not forgotten our needs, since with
so much climbing up and down as we had been through, we were thirsty enough, so
that God furnished this <i>aguada</i>, from which we had a very good drink. In about
an eighth of a mile we came to the descent from this height, after which we passed
two days of woods, some that were somewhat level, without so many or so high hills,
but it is wonderful that though these forests in which we traveled for two days
and the three preceding ones, consist of an infinite number of <i>sapote</i> and <i>ramon</i>
trees, we did not find in them all a bit to eat,--a thing which happens in these
woods as in the rest that I saw. Seeing their sterility, I said, &#39;They appeared
in every respect like those of Gilboa.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Deserted Buildings</b>. &quot;With so few comforts and so great affliction,
our strength went on diminishing very quickly, knowing for truth the proverb which
the Biscayans, my fellow countrymen, say: &#39;It is the guts which carry and support
the legs and not the legs, the guts.&#39; Among these high hills which we passed over,
there is a variety of old buildings, excepting some in which I recognized apartments,
and though they were very high and my strength was little, I climbed up them (though
with trouble). They were in the form of a convent, with the small cloisters and
many living rooms all roofed over, and arched like a wagon and whitened inside with
plaster, which is very abundant through that region, since all the ridges are composed
of it. So that these buildings do not resemble those which are here in this Province,
for the latter are of pure worked stone, laid without mortar, particularly the part
which relates to arches; but the former are of rough stone and mortar, covered with
plaster.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>False Hopes; Further Hardships</b>. &quot;It seemed to us that these
buildings stood near a settlement, from the information which the soldiers had given
us, when we were going on the new road to Guatemala, but it turned out to be the
dream of a blind man, since we found ourselves, as we saw afterwards, very far from
a settlement. We traveled through these woods when we came upon a dry river, which
we followed a long while to see if we found water, which we came across, though
late, which is better than never. Before that, God willed that we should meet a
<i>Kamas</i>, or a great mound of earth, which the ants build, in which we found a little
honey to eat, and, as every sweet thing at once calls for water, and we were late
in finding it, it did not fail to give us trouble. By following the abovementioned
river, we came to the said <i>aguada</i>, which was quite large, similar to those which
they call <i>Petens</i>. This made us go around through plenty of woods and affliction,
so as to get past it.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>They Face Starvation</b>. &quot;We passed the said <i>aguada</i> and afterwards
some hills, with other rivers, although they were dry, though the hollows in them
were a proof of their being very full in the rainy season. The signs were not deceptive,
for at a little distance we fell in with a great <i>cibal</i> or pond full of those grasses
with broad and cutting leaves, of which I spoke before. This was, according to its
distance which was lost to sight, more than two leagues long and half a league broad.
Into this discharged the currents of the rivers of which I spoke, and it cost us
much trouble to go around it, so as to pass it, changing our course in this, as
in the other cases, which I have spoken of, always to the North. In all this time
we had nothing to eat, except the little honey that I spoke of, so that the animated
mass of bones, owing to the continued troubles of traveling every day and not eating,
now kept growing weaker and weaker. In such a great extremity of a man&#39;s dying without
sickness or infirmity, being in his perfect senses, one can well understand what
cries he would utter to God and to his most holy mother, and to all the saints of
his prayers, not only intended for his bodily comfort, but in order that he should
not die among beasts without the sacraments and in order that God should bring him
to die among brothers as a Catholic, and receive the holy sacraments.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>A Sign from our Lady of the Apparition</b>. &quot;The affliction which
my dying without them among those wild trees caused me, God, on whom my heart called,
alone knows. In like manner, there was not a saint of my prayers to whom I did not
pray, and even lovingly complained that they should leave me in this way to die
in these woods; yet my thinking that, if this should happen, it would probably be
the will of God, was what mitigated all my sufferings. Nevertheless among all the
Saints I called upon to bring me out to die in a settlement, was our Lady who appeared
at Campeche, and scarcely did I call upon her in my mind (for thus were all my pleas)
to come to my aid, when at once we saw bent branches of trees, a proof that people
had come through those places. From then on I put away the needle in the sleeve
of my habit, without taking it out, following the said track wherever it went. I
kept on following it for four days through paths as clear as they were different
from those we had found. The Indians were troubled when they saw that I was going
in a contrary direction and advised me to leave such trails and to go in a westerly
direction. I, who alone knew how the said <i>Batche</i> signs appeared on my invoking
our Lady of the Apparition, replied to them that they should come along since whoever
had showed me that <i>Batche</i> or broken branches (which is a road for Indians) would
bring us out to a settlement.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;This is certain that at this time I was going on,
falling and getting up again, on account of my needs, but my faith was always strong
and firm that our Lady of the Apparition was going to bring us out safely. At the
end of the said four days of following the <i>Batche</i> or broken branches, in such
different directions, for sometimes they went to the East, at other times to the
North, and at others to the South, we finally came across a path, broad and good,
on which it was evident that a little while before Indians had passed and that there
was frequent passing. The Indians wished to follow it towards the East, in case
there were (as there were, from what I knew afterwards) any farms there, in which
they might find something to sustain ourselves. But I did not let them go, since
the sure thing was to follow it to the West, where either a settlement or the road
from Guatemala, which we were searching for, could not fail us. At this time we
were going on with a strong desire to reach it, but with little courage; wherefore
we stopped to sleep on the road.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>They Climb Some High Hills</b>. &quot;On the next day we went on over
some high hills, difficult to climb; then, on passing over one which is ascended
on the bank of a stream with but little water in it, one of the two Indians who
accompanied me carried me, so that I could pass over it or climb it. There was no
need for the hill to be very high (and it was not) for me not to be able to climb
it, since now there was left to me in all my body only the bones and the skin and
the spirit which animated them. In a little while I gave up at once, without being
able to take a step forward, although my wish was to go on and the Indians encouraged
me. This was a thing which gave them great trouble, for they also now were reeling
from weakness. I, seeing that they would be missed more, if they died than if I
did, since they had families of wife, children, mother and brother, and that I had
only God, to whom I had delivered my soul and life, I made an agreement with them,
that they should leave me there under a tree, and that they should try to save their
lives, with the understanding that, if they got out in a short time to a settlement,
they should come back to see me in a few days and to bring me some aid, for if I
did not follow them, it was not from want of wish or spirit to do so, but from want
of strength. They grieved much over this resolution of mine, on account of the love
which they had come to have for me, and so they replied to me that they were not
going to leave me, but that where I should die, they were going to die also. I (perhaps
by divine inspiration) insisted that they should go on and leave me, to the point
of commanding them with firmness to do so, provided that they should come to see
me, whenever they found supplies, for I trusted in God that they would find me alive.
With this determination of mine, they obeyed me, cutting off as they could leaves
or branches of palms, and they made me a little hut in which to remain at rest.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Avendaño Left Alone</b>. &quot;At the same time they left me a fire
lighted, and it was a prodigy for them to have lighted it, since on other occasions
they had not been able to make a fire, because they lacked strength in their hands
to prepare or bore the said sticks with which fire is made. They also left me half
a gourd of water to cool my throat, so that it might not be closed up. Having done
all this with great tenderness and with tears, they took leave of me, and I, giving
them my benediction, and showing them a like tenderness, embraced them also and
sent them away, asking my most holy Mother of the Apparition to take them shortly
and safely.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;I then as one who remained to die, without knowing whether the Indians
would come back or not, endeavored to prepare myself with a <i>santo christo</i> which
I had with me, consoling myself with it, as one who had no other company and needed
the <i>santo christo</i> so much in that time of trial. With it I conversed and I accused
myself of all my faults before it, as one who could pardon them. Having finished
reciting the divine service, I got ready to bless a little roll of paper which I
had, so as, on seeing that I was failing, to burn it; in the fire, which was at
my side. At once I read the prayers for the dying with the litanies, etc., after
which I returned to my conversations with the <i>santo christo</i>, which finished, I
recited a vigil, celebrating my burial.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Miracle of the Sapote</b>. &quot;I was engaged in these exercises,
when suddenly, though there were no <i>sapote</i> trees where I was, there came a squirrel
down a low tree, with a <i>sapote</i> in his little paws, and giving two jumps in my
presence, it showed its little teeth and went away. I was not able to stir, but
with a little stick which was at my side, I drew this <i>sapote</i> to me and ate it,
for it was as ripe and sweet as honey. The wonder is that in thousands of <i>sapotes</i>
which we found in these forests, we did not come across a single good piece of one;
and here without there being a tree, that little animal brought a ripe one. I knew
then that God sent me that aid, like another Saint Paul, although I was very far
from imitating him in his virtues, but rather that God might show his greater mercy
to such a great sinner as I. I gave him thanks with some tenderness for such a kindness,
hoping with more confidence now that I should not die of hunger. In doing this and
saying my prayers, I passed the whole day and night, awaiting every moment the hour
of dawn.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Rescued</b>. &quot;Much neglected by human aid (and even forgotten)
was I, when it dawned the next day, since in six or eight days at the least, I did
not expect any result from the two Indians whom I had sent off. I rested in this
supposition as soon as it dawned and I gave thanks to God for having brought me
safely through that night, etc. I set about reciting the divine service, which I
never failed to recite in these forests, nor was it ever absent from my mind, when
suddenly I heard a noise of people, and on turning my eyes, I saw some ten Indians
of the town of Mani and its suburbs, who came to get me. I did not take them for
men, but for angels, and as such they acted in my case in everything. Scarcely had
they come to where I was, when with great affection they ran to embrace me, shedding
plenty of tears, and at the same time, saying a thousand tender words to me. I could
not restrain myself at this kindness, when I thought also of such an unexpected
blessing as God had shown me. On the other hand it caused me to feel more kindly,
when I saw that a people as impious as the Indians naturally are, should be so merciful
to me, as never have I seen such a thing in them.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;They brought me a little meal
that they eat, and in a moment they warmed it so that I could drink it, they supporting
me, one on one side and one on the other, so that I might keep seated. They revived
the fire which was there, and warming up six cloaks very nicely, they wrapped me
up in them, and warmed my extremities, that is, my feet and hands, since they were
numb from weakness and cold air; I recovered by means of that warmth and food which
I drank, and in order to raise me, they held aloft my whole body, stiff as if it
was a sculptured statue. They brought a hammock in which they took me to the town
of Chuntucí, from which I set out when I went among the said Ytzaes, and to which
the said Indians who carried me were loading up to go.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><b>What had Happened to the Indians whom Avendaño Sent off</b>. &quot;Portentous
surely was the present event, if all the circumstances are considered. The two Indians
left my presence, whom I sent off against their will, so as to save their lives,
forcing them to leave me alone. Everything happened through a higher direction,--first
since the said Indians went on falling and getting up again, from their want of
strength, and in spite of all this, they followed the path which led from where
they left me up to the town of Chuntucí, which they reached in an hour and a half,
for they only stopped long enough to take some refreshment with the said carriers,
and to tell them how I was left to die in the forest. Scarcely had they heard this,
when without any delay, they started out to come and get me, and the distance which
it took my two Indians to go in an hour and a half, the said carriers had to take
a day and a half in finding me, without their losing their road, by which the miracle
can easily be understood. Secondly, that my Indians, coming to Chuntucí, and meeting
these carriers loading, was all one (i.e., simultaneous), so that if they had stopped
even a little, they would not have met them, and consequently would not have found
supplies to bring to me, and even less should I have been able to start out for
a settlement. Therefore the hurry which I showed in sending them away was by divine
direction. They took me in the said hammock, and though it was a convenience on
account of the rest that it gave, it was also some affliction to me, since, although
they wrapped me up very well in their cloaks, every little while it gave me cramps
in all my body, I being stiff and cold from head to foot. At which they warmed the
cloaks again, and rubbing my hands and feet with them all warm, the muscles again
were stretched, although it lasted but a short time. At last I reached the town
of Chuntucí, on the Sunday of Septuagesima, which was on the 19th of February, in
this year of sixteen hundred and ninety-six, about three o&#39;clock in the afternoon,--a
result surely very different from what I thought,--that I should ever be in the
said town again, after the extremity to which I had come. All that afternoon I stayed
looking at this town, and I did not believe yet that I was really there. Blessed
be the mercy of God, who showed it thus in my case. For his divine Majesty alone,
of his own accord, could show such compassion on this miserable sinner. Infinite
thanks be given for so great blessings as he gave me, and may his divine Majesty
so will, that it redound to his honor and glory through infinite centuries of centuries.
Amen. The Indian carriers continued in their pious work of conveying me and of caring
for my Indian singers, so that both in them and in me, a great change of condition
resulted from the fresh food, which put us on the road to life.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Avendaño set out
shortly afterwards for Merida.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Messenger from Tayasal</b>. When he and his companions reached
Merida they were told of the arrival of a messenger from Canek of Tayasal. This
messenger had reached Merida considerably before the time at which the Padres left
Tayasal. He had been received by the Governor and society of Merida with great rejoicings
because of the fact that he announced that his errand was to proffer the allegiance
of Canek and all his subjects, some eighty thousand Indians in all.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Reasons for Avendaño&#39;s Distrust</b>. Avendaño found it difficult
to credit this news for several reasons, the chief of which were:</p>
<p class="normal">First. The obvious
fact that, at the time he (Avendaño) was last at Tayasal, Canek was unable to force
his subjects to adopt Christianity on account of the hostility of Covoh and others.</p>
<p class="normal">Second. That, in spite of the intimacy that had existed between Canek and Avendaño,
the latter had never received the slightest hint of Canek&#39;s intention of sending
any such messenger.</p>
<p class="normal">Third. That Canek, had such a messenger really been sent while
the Padres were with him, would most certainly have detained them as hostages until
the safe return of the messenger.</p>
<p class="normal">Avendaño (p. 66 recto) closes his narrative thus:</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;I omit, so as not to cause annoyance, many other effective reasons, which I could
give, but I leave it to the consideration of any one who should reflect on this
matter, better than I. As for me, who saw and was in touch with it all, I am satisfied
with what I have said. And, in reference to the common opinion of all the Province,
I say that the large part of it is of the opinion that the said message was false....&quot;</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="div1Ref_10.0" href="#div1_10.0">CHAPTER X</a></h2>
<h3>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CONQUEST OF TAYASAL<br>
BY THE SPANIARDS, 1695-1696</h3>
<p class="continue"><b>The Expedition from Guatemala Reaches Cahabon</b>. It will be remembered
that Fray Alonso Cano, the Augustine friar who had accompanied the first, and unsuccessful,
entrada from Guatemala, had returned to that city in the autumn of 1695. He remained
there until December of that same year, when he set out once more for the north,
reaching Cahabon in January, 1696. There Cano and his companions awaited the arrival
of Doctor Don Bartholomé de Amezquita, who, in his capacity of Oidor and Alcalde
Ordinario of the Audiencia of Guatemala, was to lead the expedition. Amezquita arrived
early in February, and with him came Captain Juan Diaz de Velasco. They found Cahabon
in a bad condition on account of the lack of preparations and because of the heavy
rains.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Preliminary Movements and Plans</b>. In order to appease the zeal
of those who were urging that the expedition proceed with all speed, it was decided
that Captain Diaz de Velasco should go ahead of the main body of troops. He took
with him seventy soldiers and thirty Indians; Cano went with him. Guided by the
Itza named Cuixam or Cuixan, Diaz de Velasco set forth from Mopan (whither the force
had moved) on March 7. It was arranged that, from a place called Yxbol, near Tayasal,
Cuixam was to be sent on to ascertain Canek&#39;s attitude, and that the Captain, Diaz
de Velasco, and his men were to wait for him. On the tenth of March, Amezquita and
Cano left Mopan. They kept receiving letters and messages from those ahead until
they reached the Chacal River, where all traces of their vanguard completely vanished.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Fate of Diaz de Velasco; Amezquita Follows him</b>. The reason
for this cessation of communication was briefly as follows: Captain Diaz de Velasco
sent Cuixam ahead, as had been planned, to Tayasal. Cuixam reported that two Franciscans
were on the island. The Captain would not believe this. Still, he was so bold as
to embark in a canoe rowed by natives, who, as soon as the vessel was clear of the
shore, began a sharp struggle which resulted in the death of all the Spaniards in
the party. In due course Amezquita followed in the footsteps of the ill-fated Captain.
On arriving at the shores of the lake he learned the fate that had befallen Diaz
de Velasco. Seeing that there was nothing he could do with so small a force as that
which he had at his disposal, Amezquita withdrew to Chacal, and later on, by the
order of Don Gabriel Sanchez de Berrospe, the new President of the Audiencia of
Guatemala, he withdrew to Guatemala City.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Conclusion of the Subjection of the Itzas Begun</b>. After the
series of events which we have just studied came to an end there was, for a time,
a lull in the war. Our knowledge of the incidents which followed the break is derived
from Villagutierre y Sotomayor. (Lib. v, caps. 7, 8, etc.) According to this authority,
events occurred in the following order.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Parades is Ordered to March to Los Dolores</b>. Ursua determined
to bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion by means of another expedition into
the Itza country. Accordingly he sent his orders to Alonso Garcia de Paredes, who,
with the soldiers of that unsuccessful expedition on which Avendaño had gone, was
still in Tzucthok. In substance Paredes was ordered to go and place himself and
his men under the orders of the President of Guatemala or his successor. To this
end he was to go south from Tzucthok, and always &quot;trying to incline his route a
little toward the left hand, or towards the east, was to place himself in sight
of the town of Lacandones, which the President had discovered and named Nuestra
Señora de los Dolores.&quot;<a name="div2Ref_10.1" href="#div2_10.1"><sup>10.1</sup></a> Paredes was to fortify himself there about five leagues
from the town of Lacandon, and he was to stay there without molesting the surrounding
settlements. From the time of receiving these instructions to the time when he built
his stockaded redoubt he was to take especial care to inform himself concerning
the people round about, and especially those along the road which was being built.
On arriving in the neighborhood of Lacandon and after the founding of the redoubt,
Paredes was to go to the President so as to hand over to him the various letters
that he bore and so as to place himself under his orders. Thereafter, if circumstances
permitted, he was to go as soon as possible to the Itzas, together with a suitable
number of Padres and soldiers. He; was ordered to subject and catechize the natives.</p>
<p class="normal">Paredes appointed as officers Don Joseph de Estenoz, Pedro de Zuviaur, Joseph Laynez,
and Mateo Hidalgo, who had been picked out by Ursua for their various posts. From
this point on we have the account of Avendaño to rely upon until after the Padre&#39;s
withdrawal to Merida. An uprising on the part of the Cacique Covoh, as we know,
was the immediate cause of the retirement. It did not have, however, a permanently
discouraging effect.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Canek&#39;s Ambassador, Can, Arrives at Merida</b>. In the last third
of December, 1695, while Avendaño was still in the wilderness, an ambassador named
Can arrived at Merida from Canek.<a name="div2Ref_10.2" href="#div2_10.2"><sup>10.2</sup></a> He was accompanied by three kinsmen of his,
together with some Muzules Indians. Ursua himself came out to meet him with a great
following. The parties met at the convent of the Mejorada; thence the embassy was
taken to the cathedral and to the palace. Can then said that his uncle, Canek, asked
for Padres so that Christianity might be introduced among the Itzas. A suitable
reply was given, and the ambassador was baptized. (Villagutierre, lib. vi, caps.
3-5.) Can told Ursua that his uncle, Canek, had four Kings under him who were his
vassals. They were Citcan, Ahamatan, Ahkin, and Ahitcan, as well as Ahatsi. Can
was baptized Martin Francisco Can and his brother Miguel Can. Finally, after many
ceremonies and solemn masses, Ursua sent them home with much good feeling. An escort
headed by Captain Francisco de Hariza or Ariza of Bacalar set forth for the Itzas.
Ursua sent word of all these developments to Paredes, ordering him, as well as Hariza,
to do all that was necessary for the winning or conquering of Canek and his vassals.</p>
<p class="normal">Meanwhile the new President of Guatemala, Escals, was taking all possible precautions
for the furtherance of the design. His division of the expedition, of which Fray
Agustín Cano was a part, left Guatemala in January, 1696. There is no need to tell
again what happened, as Cano has already told us all up to a certain point.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Zuviaur Goes to the Lake</b>. The early weeks of 1696, then, were
spent by Avendaño and the men of Yucatan in Peten and in the wilderness between
it and Tipu, to which the Padres were enabled to flee by Canek, who knew well the
plots that were being hatched against them by Covoh and by Canek&#39;s wife.</p>
<p class="normal">Shortly
after Avendaño reached Merida and made his report, Ursua dispatched Captain Don
Pedro de Zuviaur with seventy men, enough Indians, and Padre Juan San Buenaventura
to the lake by way of the route so lately followed by Avendaño. The Itzas received
them armed for war. Padre San Buenaventura, however, partly calmed them by smooth
words; fighting did not, however, entirely cease, and before long Zuviaur returned
to the royal camp. At about the same time an Indian messenger arrived from Hariza,
who was in the neighborhood of Tipu, with the information that the Franciscans who
were administering the villages along the road were meeting with a fair measure
of success, and that the Itzas were the only remaining obstacle to the completion
of the undertaking. Hourly they became more threatening and more dangerous. Several
skirmishes took place between them and the men of Paredes. Finally, forced by lack
of supplies, Paredes withdrew with all his men into the province.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Ursua Determines to Take Vigorous Measures</b>. Clearly enough,
in Ursua&#39;s opinion, things were far from being in a satisfactory condition. He made
up his mind that a stop must be put to the menace of the Itzas at all costs, and
he determined to go in person upon this definitive expedition. He made especially
elaborate and adequate preparations, doing things which should have been done long
before. He assembled a sufficient number of carpenters to build brigantines and
<i>pyraguas</i> on the shore of the lake, and he got together ample stores. Nothing was
said of all this to the King of Castile, as it was notorious that he would have
frowned upon such military preparations.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Lawsuits between Soberanis and Ursua</b>. At this time the old
enmity between Soberanis and Ursua reawakened. Soberanis was at the viceregal court,
where, during the reign of the Conde de Galve, he opposed Ursua&#39;s interests and
plans with some success. Galve was succeeded, however, by Don Juan de Ortega Montañes,
Bishop of Michoacan, who was appointed Viceroy <i>ad interim</i> of Mexico. Ortega, being
a broad-minded man, could see the good of the wishes of both sides, and he determined
that the whole matter should be laid before the Council of the Indies. The result
was a long lawsuit, during which it became clear that Soberanis wished for more
territory for his King, while Ursua wanted more vassals. A series of lawsuits, stained
by false charges, perjury, and petty recriminations (mostly on the part of Soberanis
and his party), followed. It is a matter which is very involved and for us unimportant,
as it did not alter the current of events in the region of Tayasal.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Captain Parades at Tzucthok</b>. While these lawsuits were dragging
on, Captain Alonso Garcia de Paredes arrived at the bank of the large river (Nohukum?).
After building a <i>pyragua</i> he and twenty men embarked on it and went up the river
to its source, where they captured ten canoes. Soon after they returned to Tzucthok
on account of the rainy season.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Captain Hariza at Tipu</b>. Meanwhile Can, with Captain Francisco
de Hariza and an escort of thirty soldiers, had returned to Tipu from Merida. At
the former place they learned how Paredes had sent soldiers to the lake under Zuviaur,
how some had been taken prisoners there and put to death, and how the Gran Cayo
and its islands were devastated because the Indians had wished to kill their King
Canek on account of his friendly attitude toward the Spaniards. In the trial of
one Pablo Gil of Salamanca, who at this time was accused of conspiracy, it came
out that this revolution at Peten had occurred soon after the departure of Can for
Merida. The <i>zamaguales</i> or common people were incensed with Canek because he had
sent his nephew to Yucatan. When Can returned to Peten he found that his uncle was
still in power but not entirely secure. Can was unable to return to his own village
eight leagues away because it was subject to Cintanek, who was at war with Canek.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Cacique Cintanek&#39;s Villages</b>. The five villages of Cintanek
were Chaltuna, Sac peten, Maconche, Saca, and Coba. The nine villages subject, at
this time, to Canek were Oraptun, Zacpui, Chee, Chacha, Sacfinil, Linil, Oboncox,
Chulul, and Eckixil. (Cf. Villagutierre, p. 435.) The people in these villages were
very numerous; they knew nothing of the Kingdom of Guatemala beyond the fact that
some five leagues away was a place called Mopan.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Can&#39;s Report</b>. The Indians, Can and others, related how fifteen
Spanish men came to the Indians of the Gran Cayo and asked for provisions, which
were brought to them. (These Spaniards were, no doubt, a party sent out by Paredes
just before he withdrew.) Even as they were eating, musket shots were heard on the
shore. At once those who were eating on the island judged their companions were
in danger and hastily armed themselves. A fight quickly took place, and the Spaniards
even attacked the person of Canek himself. At length, however, the Spaniards fled.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Commands of King Charles II</b>. At last the letters and reports
which, at the insistence of Ortega Montañes, the Viceroy Bishop, had been sent to
the court of Spain earlier in the year, bore fruit, for the King sent new dispatches
ordering Don Martin thus: acknowledgment was made of the good work done by Sargento
Mayor, Don Martin de Ursua y Arizmendi, as well as of that done by Captain Alonso
Garcia de Paredes, Captain Joseph Fernandez de Estenoz, and others. Don Roque de
Soberanis y Centeno was ordered to give all possible assistance to Ursua and to
refrain from hindering him in any way. The cedulas were signed at Buen Retiro on
May 29, 1696. These dispatches, together with a commendatory letter from the Conde
de Adanero, President of the Council of the Indies, arrived in Yucatan late in 1696.
Fortunately Ursua had already made all his preparations for the next campaign. Don
Martin sent copies of the cedulas and letter to the newly arrived Viceroy of Mexico,
the Conde de Moctezuma, to the Audience of Guatemala, and to the Reverendissimo
Don Fray Antonio de Arriaga, Bishop of Yucatan.</p>
<p class="normal">Before setting out there was one
more formality to go through. Ursua therefore sent the orders of the King to Don
Roque, asking him at the same time for certain aid. (Villagutierre, lib. viii, cap.
2.) Straightway Don Roque sent Don Juan Geronimo de Abad to Campeche to inform Ursua
that Soberanis would give him all necessary aid for the fulfilment of the royal
will. He also ordered Ursua to pick out those persons whom he thought ought to be
captains, and Don Roque promised to confirm the appointments.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Soberanis and Ursua in Agreement at Last</b>. Abad executed his
errand and Don Martin replied that only the very numerous infidel Indians of the
Laguna del Itza stood between him and the successful completion of the road, which
was already open on the north almost as far as the lake and on the south as far
as Cahabon. The intervening region contained the Itzas, whom Ursua purposed to conquer.
He had already chosen as captains Alonso Garcia de Paredes, Joseph Fernandez de
Estenoz, Pedro de Zuviaur, and Roque Gutierrez. At the same time Don Martin informed
Abad that he had prepared all sorts of supplies and munitions, and he begged Don
Roque de Soberanis to furnish him with advice as to the proper payment for various
things. Don Roque approved of everything that Don Martin proposed, and he ordered
that Abad, together with a scrivener and an interpreter, should see to the proper
financial arrangements.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Part to be Taken by Indian Villages</b>. Ursua then asked that
the mountain villages of Tecax and Oxcuscab should be made to supply service Indians.
These, if granted, were to be under the orders of the captain of Tecax; but Soberanis
pointed out that those villages had already done their share, and so he ordered
that the Caciques of Zotuta, Yaxcava, Tixcacal, and Peto should furnish the needed
labor. The part each was to take was as follows:</p>
<table style="width:80%; margin-left:10%">
<tr>
<td>Zotuta</td>
<td>16 mules;</td>
<td>16 arrieros;</td>
<td>16 other Indians</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Yaxcava</td>
<td>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
<td>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
<td>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tixcacal</td>
<td>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
<td>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
<td>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Peto</td>
<td>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
<td>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td>
<td>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</td></tr></table>

<p class="continue">All these Indians were to be in charge of Don Juan del Castillo, captain
of Tecax. Indians from Mani were to carry the supplies.</p>
<p class="normal">On January 23, 1697, Don
Martin de Ursua set forth from Campeche after giving thanks for aid received. On
arriving at Tzucthok they took the same road as on previous occasions. They camped
at length two leagues from the lake, having passed through Batcab. On the way south
they learned that the cacique of Tzucthok and some of the Indians of that village
had retired to such places as Apelchen, Bolonchen, Chabuhic, and Sacauchen. Some
of the Chanes, however, remained faithful, for which Ursua rewarded them with presents.
At about this time also, although Ursua probably did not know of it, Berrospe had
ordered the troops of Guatemala to withdraw definitely from Mopan and other places.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Road Completed as Far as the Lake</b>. At the end of February
and in early March the two leagues of road between the camp and the lake were completed.
<i>Pyraguas</i> had already been built and were finished by the time the army encamped
on the lake shore. Seeing such a display of power, the Indians tried to rival it,
but when they saw the galley and <i>pyraguas</i> they retired to their island. There
were sundry attempts to make friends with the Indians, but they showed themselves
utterly undeserving of confidence. On March 10, 1697, Don Martin Can, he who had
gone to Merida as ambassador for his uncle Canek and who was godson of Ursua, hearing
of the latter&#39;s arrival, came to him joyfully. As a result of this the murmurs to
the effect that he was a myth entirely vanished.</p>
<p class="normal">Some squads of Indians approached
the camp by land with arms. The general soon saw it was but a pugnacious attempt
to force the Spaniards into a skirmish. At the same moment a large canoe beached
on the shore where the camp was. Can said that those in it were Chamaxculu and other
important Indians from Alain. They were received with all possible cordiality, and
some of the Indians were found to be those who had been in Merida with Can. Chamaxculu
was an old man of seventy years.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Quincanek Feigns Friendliness</b>. Very soon after that Quincanek
visited the camp. He was cordially welcomed and in conversation he promised to aid
the opening of the road. Ursua discreetly decided it would be superfluous to make
any allusion at that time to the idolatry, treachery, and other foibles of the Itzas.
Everything seemed serene and amicable. The chiefs promised to return for dinner
later.</p>
<p class="normal">They remained where they were from March 10 to 12, 1697. During
those three days many Indian women came in canoes and unattended from Peten to the
camp. Whether their purpose was to get themselves violated and thereby furnish an
excuse to the lurking squads of Indians to attack the Spaniards, or whether they
were led by mere curiosity, is not absolutely certain; but it is probable that the
former was the case, for when, through good discipline, Ursua managed to restrain
his men, the women made all sorts of obscene gestures to attract the soldiers, but
to no purpose.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Hostilities Begin</b>. Finally the day arrived on which, according
to his promise, Quincanek, was to bring Canek to dinner with Ursua. But instead
of a peaceful Canek and Quincanek coming to have dinner with them, the Spaniards
saw a huge fleet of canoes all decked out in warlike array approaching them. This,
however, did not greatly dismay the Spaniards, as they knew that their own galley
and <i>pyraguas</i>, which were all in readiness, would give them an immense advantage.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>The Captains Urge Ursua to Fight; the Battle</b>. Ursua called
a council of war in which Paredes, Estenoz, Zuviaur, and all the other captains
urged him to use force and thereby to conquer the Itzas finally. Ursua was still
determined, however, to maintain peace as long as possible, being mindful of the
King&#39;s wish.</p>
<p class="normal">On the following day, March 13, 1697, Ursua determined to go to the
Peten Grande, which lay two leagues from his camp. Leaving a good garrison in the
camp, he took two hundred men and Don Martin Can in the boats and sailed for Peten.
Before long the Spaniards, who were under the strictest orders not to fire, were
surrounded by a large fleet of canoes filled with Itzas, who shot arrows at the
invaders. As one would naturally expect, all attempts to reason with the outraged
Itzas proved futile. Finally one Bartolomé Duran, maddened by an arrow wound, fired
off his gun. This precipitated a hot skirmish in which everyone took part. At the
end of it the Spaniards got upon the shore, and by means of the artillery at length
put the Itzas to flight. The latter fled away as fast as they could by swimming,
and when in due time Ursua and his men got to Peten Grande, they found nothing but
old women and little children there. All who could had fled into and across the
lake rather than face the vengeance of the Spaniards.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Tayasal Becomes a Spanish Possession</b>. The battle was over by
eight in the morning. The standard of Jesus Christ was set up; the royal arms were
engraved over the door of what had been the principal temple; and thanks were given
to God for the victory. A church was founded and the houses of the idols were cleaned
out. Oddly enough the temple where Canek and his idolatrous priests had once torn
out human hearts was chosen as the Christians&#39; place of worship.</p>
<p class="normal">Thus ends the history
of the long, brave but fruitless struggle of the Itzas against the Spanish conquerors.
After so many romantic interests it is but natural that any account of subsequent
events should be an anti-climax. The later history of the Itza country can be dismissed
in a word.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>Later History of Tayasal</b>. Since the conquest, Tayasal has been
a mere Spanish provincial village with nothing to distinguish it from scores of
others. In the first half of the nineteenth century serious insurrections took place
in the region. At about the same period the name Tayasal was taken away and Flores
was substituted, in honor of one Cyrilo Flores, a local patriot. It is a pity that
the old, unusual, and euphonious name was not kept. At present Flores (Pl. III)
is the capital of the Department of Peten, Guatemala.</p>

<h3>THE QUESTION OF ORTHOGRAPHY</h3>
<p class="continue">Possibly the reader has noted in these pages a tendency toward
inconsistency in the matter of spelling proper names. I do not deny that I have
failed to avoid such inconsistency, but at the outset, after due thought on the
matter, I decided that it is most difficult to try and lay down any hard and fast
rule for the spelling of the proper names used in this book. In many cases it is
utterly impossible to say &quot;This is the correct spelling of this name.&quot; To show just
the nature of the sort of orthographical variations encountered in this work I give
here most of the variants of the name Itza.</p>

become blurred either through exposure to dampness or from some other cause. In

<h3>THE MAPS OF YUCATAN, 1501-1800</h3>
<p class="continue">While I was at work on the main body of this book my attention
was drawn to the question of cartography by Dr. Edward Luther Stevenson of New York.
I decided that it would be worth while to try and compile a list of all the early
maps of Yucatan. It would be folly for me to claim that the list I give here is
complete; it is, however, at least as complete as any such list now existing. No
attempt has been made to list all the modern maps of the area; neither has there
been any attempt to include maps of limited portions of the peninsula. A selection
from the immense amount of material given by Pedro Torres Lanzas has, however, been
made, and the notes made by Dr. Tozzer in Seville are appended.</p>

<p class="normal">Valentini (1898, 1902) refers
to this map as being dated either in 1493 or 1502. There is little doubt that this
map is misdated for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="normal">1. The information contained in the map
is so full that it cannot have been earlier than 1520.</p>
<p class="normal">2. The nomenclature is mainly
&quot;sailor names&quot; and therefore inconclusive.</p>
<p class="normal">3. The alleged Yucatan runs from its
nearest point to Cuba northwardly, not southwardly. It is my belief that the peninsula
in question is meant for Florida, and that it is too far west.</p>
<p class="normal">4. The whole style
of the map is comparable to that of the following well-known ones: Turin-Spanish,
1523-25; Wolfenbüttel-Spanish, 1525-30; Maggiolo, 1527; Verrazano, 1529; Weimar-Spanish,
1527. It is for more full and accurate than Maggiolo, 1519. Therefore it cannot
date from before 1520, and probably not from before 1525.</p></td>

<p class="normal">From the foregoing list of maps the following interesting
points are to be gleaned:</p>
<p class="normal">1. Yucatan does not appear on any map prior to 1523-1525.
From the time of its first discovery Yucatan was believed to be an island. Maps
vary greatly as to what sort of an island it was.</p>
<p class="normal">2. In 1527 the Weimar-Spanish
map shows Yucatan for the first time as a peninsula. Probably the maker of this
map derived his information from someone who had been with Cortes in 1524-1525.
The name Ytza appears on the isthmus; it is so faint as to be almost illegible,
but I think I have deciphered it correctly.</p>
<p class="normal">3. From 1529 (Ribero) to 1548 (Venice
&quot;Ptolemy&quot;) geographical knowledge of Yucatan falls off badly. With only two exceptions
(Mercator, 1536, and Santa Cruz, 1542) the maps of this period show Yucatan as an
island more or less remote from the mainland. I think that the comparative accuracy
of Alonso de Santa Cruz is accounted for by the fact that he was official cartographer
to the crown of Castile and that he had official information of Montejo&#39;s explorations,
1526-1541.</p>
<p class="normal">4. From 1551 onward Yucatan is usually shown as a peninsula; but even
so late as this there are exceptions such as Ferrando Berteli, 1560, and Gulielmus
Nicolai, 1603, whose inaccuracies are many.</p>
<p class="normal">5. In Sanson d&#39;Abbeville, 1656, the
Itzas appear again, this time under the name of Yzues. They and the Cocomes are
misplaced, being too far north. It is barely possible that the entradas of Fuensalida
and Orbita and Delgado, 1618-1624, may have had some influence on this map.</p>
<p class="normal">6. In Blaauw, 1667, we have the first step toward a really accurate map of Yucatan. This
map bears many place names, among them the Yzaes and the Cocomes.</p>
<p class="normal">7. About 1714
Henry Popple, the great London map maker, made an excellent map of the region. On
it Lake Peten is rightly located. There can be but little doubt that Popple derived
his information from the English in British Honduras. Through them he probably learned
of the conquest of the Itzas. It is not impossible, of course, that he was also
acquainted with the writings of Cogolludo and Villagutierre, but that does not seem
very likely. From that time onward the Itzas have appeared regularly on the maps
of that region.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>
<br>
<h4>Chapter I.</h4>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_1.1" href="#div2Ref_1.1">Footnote 1.1</a>: Mr. Bowditch (1901, p. 137) says that the earliest
date at Quirigua is that on Stela C: 9.1.0.0.0. and that the latest is that on Stela
K: 9.18.15.0.0. According to his reckoning these dates correspond approximately
to 75 B.C. and 275 A.D. respectively. Mr. Bowditch informs us that other cities
in the south show similar dates, and at the same time he points out that it is possible
that these cities were occupied beyond the latest dates shown on the stelae. We
see, then, that the difference between Mr. Bowditch&#39;s computation and that of Mr.
Morley rests solely in this: according to Mr. Bowditch the Golden Age or Old Empire
had its beginnings as far back as 75 B.C.; Mr. Morley, on the other hand, believes
that up to 200 A.D. there was a wholly indefinite Migratory period which led up
to the Golden Age and to the Colonization period (that is, to 700 A.D.). From 700
onward the two systems are the same. Whatever divergence exists between Mr. Bowditch
and Mr. Morley on the subject of chronology concerns only the Golden Age or Old
Empire cities.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_1.2" href="#div2Ref_1.2">Footnote 1.2</a>: Nakum was first studied scientifically by Count Maurice
de Perigny (1908). Its importance is exceeded, however, by that of Tikal, which,
in addition to being very near Lake Peten, is now well known. Descriptions of this
elaborate group of ruins are to be found in Charnay (1887), Maudslay (1883), and
in other earlier writers. The most satisfactory work on Tikal is that of Maler and
Tozzer (1911). In both Nakum and Tikal the buildings are excellent examples of Old
Empire construction, having massive substructures, towering superstructures, and
a mass of intricate ornamentation. The dates at Tikal range from 9.2.13.0.0. to
9.15.13.0.0. (about 210-480 A.D.).</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_1.3" href="#div2Ref_1.3">Footnote 1.3</a>: This documentary history is based on the Books of
Chilan Balam. Daniel G. Brinton&#39;s translations as given in his Maya Chronicles have
been used. For bibliographical purposes the reader is referred to Tozzer, 1917.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_1.4" href="#div2Ref_1.4">Footnote 1.4</a>: Although the terms Maya and Itza are used more or
less interchangeably, it is to be noted that there is authority for believing them
to mean two separate races. Ancona (1878, vol. i, p. 31 ff.) says that the Itzas
were the earlier inhabitants of Yucatan. He adds that they worshiped Itzamna and
founded Itzamal, Tihoo, and Chichen Itza. The Maya, on the other hand, worshiped
Kukulkan, were enemies of the Itzas, and were the founders of Mayapan, Uxmal, and
other cities. This distinction, though a fine one and hard to prove correct, deserves
to be noted.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_1.5" href="#div2Ref_1.5">Footnote 1.5</a>: This name, Cocom, will be brought to our attention
later on, and it will be advisable for us to compare now the exceedingly confusing
accounts of what the Cocom family was.</p>
<p class="hang3">Brinton (1882, p. 165), in his introduction to the Book of Chilan
Balam of Chumayel, says: &quot;We have no longer to do with the reckoning of the subjects
of the Xiu family who ruled at Mani, but with one which emanates from the priests
of the Cocomes, who were hereditary masters of Chichen Itza.&quot;</p>
<p class="hang3">According to the Chronicle of Chac Xulub Chac, by Nahau Pech,
there was a king named Ixcuat Cocom of Aké, who led the people of Chichen Itza from
that place very late in their history, about eight years before the Spaniards touched
at Campeche in 1516. (Brinton, 1882, p. 218.)</p>
<p class="hang3">The Katunes of Maya History (Valentini, 1880, pp. 54, 86) say
that &quot;In the 8th Ahau the Governor of Chichen Itza was deposed because he murmured
disrespectfully of Hunac-eel.&quot; The 8th Ahau would be about 1422-1444.</p>
<p class="hang3">Brasseur de Bourbourg (1858, vol. ii, p. 35) says that the Cocomes
were the kings of Mayapan and that as they became more and more tyrannical so did
the Tutul Xiu of Uxmal become more and more the champions of the people. He suggests
that Hunac-eel was a Cocom, and he also speaks of the Lord of Chichen as being quite
distinct from the Cocomes. Brasseur (cf. Lizana, 1893, p. 3) continues his account
by saying that Chac Xib Chac, who was then reigning in Chichen, likewise became
indignant at the cruelty of Hunac-eel (or Cocom). As a result of this seven Nahua
chiefs were sent by Hunac-eel against Chac Xib Chac, whom they vanquished. With
his power thus seemingly assured, Hunac-eel set about oppressing his Mexican allies,
who appealed for help to the Tutul Xiu of Uxmal, with the result that the dynasty
of Cocom was ruined (about 1440). One child of the last King of Mayapan, however,
was absent at Xicalanco, and he lived to set up a new Cocom kingdom at Tibulon or
Sotuta.</p>
<p class="hang3">Molina Solis says (1896, p. li): &quot;After the time of Hunac-eel,
the Cocomes, descendants of an ancient and rich house of the Itzaes, one of whose
members had made himself known as a man of valor in the last war, began to rule
as lords of Mayapan. The Cocomes continued the policy of their predecessor....&quot;
According to this writer it was the Cocomes who called in the people from Mexico,
in spite of whom they were overthrown. The only survivors of the massacre of the
family were a young son of the last king (as has been said) and a distant relative
named Cocom Cat, who escaped to the town of Tiab. Molina&#39;s authority for this statement
is the Relación of Juan Bote, which he quotes (p. liii). After these events the
Mexican mercenaries seized the province of Canul or Ahcanul. (Landa, 1864, p. 55.)
The Cheles founded a religious state at Izamal; the Cocomes withdrew to Sotuta and
the Xius to Mani. All this is accepted in the main by modern writers. (Tozzer, 1907,
p. 9; Faliès, 1915, vol. i, p. 247 ff.)</p>
<p class="hang3">To summarize, we may say that the Cocomes were the lords of either
Mayapan or Chichen Itza, though it is more likely they were identified with the
former. They became too ambitious and powerful to please the Tutul Xiu of Uxmal
and the ruler of Chichen; they called in Mexican mercenaries about 1200, and from
then until about 1440 they became increasingly more arrogant until, in the latter
year, the Xiu and other people who had been wronged completely destroyed the city
of Mayapan, so that only two or three members of the ruling family escaped destruction.
We have now reached the crux of this whole discussion. The three possible surviving
Cocomes were; (1) the son of the last lord of Mayapan; (2) the Cocom Cat, who, according
to Molina (quoting an old Relación), fled southward to Tiab at about that period;
and (3) King Ixcuat Cocom of Aké, who, according to Nahau Pech, also went southward,
about 1508 more or less.</p>
<p class="hang3">There is a distinct possibility that Cocom Cat may eventually
have got to Tayasal. It is likewise entirely possible to believe that from him descended
that Cocom who, with Ahchatappol and Ahauppuc, came out from Tayasal to meet Padres
Fuensalida and Orbita in 1618. (Villagutierre, p. 116.) Sapper (1904, p. 625) tells
that a Juan Pablo Cocom became the leader of an insurrection at Bacalar in May,
1848.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_1.6" href="#div2Ref_1.6">Footnote 1.6</a>: Seler (1908, p. 157 ff.) says that the Casa de las
Monjas, the Akat tz&#39;ib, and the Casa Colorada all belong to this period and that
they are to be associated with the various buildings at Uxmal, Kabah, Labna, and
elsewhere. Rain-god masks are a striking characteristic of the architecture of this
period../p&gt; <br>

<h4>Chapter III</h4>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_3.1" href="#div2Ref_3.1">Footnote 3.1</a>: The claim of the Portuguese to have visited and mapped
Yucatan is not founded on historical fact. Dr. Roger Merriman of Harvard was so
kind as to put at my disposal his historical information on the subject of early
voyages to Yucatan. It is his unqualified opinion that the map reported on by Valentini,
and discussed in the list of maps in Appendix III, is greatly misdated, being placed
about twenty to thirty years too early.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_3.2" href="#div2Ref_3.2">Footnote 3.2</a>: Yucatan, at this time, was thought to be an island.
Grijalva named it Nuestra Señora de los Remedios. (Oviedo, 1851, vol. i, p. 508.)
Soon after leaving Cozumel, Grijalva reached a small place called Lazaro, which
figures on the map known as the Turin-Spanish of 1523-1525. See Dr. Stevenson&#39;s
edition, 1903.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_3.3" href="#div2Ref_3.3">Footnote 3.3</a>: Bernal Diaz (vol. iv, p. 284) says 100 crossbowmen
and musketeers and 22 horses. Gomara (1826, vol. ii, p. 126) says 150 horses, 160
foot-soldiers, and 3000 Indians. Cogolludo (p. 44 ff.) says 130 cavalrymen, 120
musketeers, and 3000 Indians.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_3.4" href="#div2Ref_3.4">Footnote 3.4</a>: Cyrus Thomas (1885, pp. 171-172) once tried to prove
that Cortes visited Palenque. Apparently he thought that either Izancanac or the
large town reached after that was Palenque. This belief was proved to be erroneous
by Brinton, who said (1885 a) that Cortes never reached Palenque, but passed to
the north of it. Maler (1901, pp. 105-106) also discusses this point.</p>

was wounded in the foot either during the deer hunt described above or while crossing
the Mountain of Alabaster. Morzillo&#39;s injuries were so severe that he became a burden
to the expedition, and Cortes left him behind with Canek, charging the latter to
take good care of him. When Morzillo died, probably from lack of proper food, the
Itzas made an image of him which they treated as an idol. In 1618 Padre Orbita,
infuriated by this idol and the worship accorded it, shattered the image.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_3.7" href="#div2Ref_3.7">Footnote 3.7</a>: I am at a loss to explain why Gomara heads his chapter
&quot;De como Canec quemo los Idolos.&quot; Canek, according to most accounts, did not actually
burn the idols; he merely promised to do so.</p>

<h4>Chapter IV</h4>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_4.1" href="#div2Ref_4.1">Footnote 4.1</a>: These names are a puzzle; it may be that these men
later in life became identified with the two cities whose names they adopted. There
is neither a Lima nor a Quito in Spain, as both those names are of American origin.
Lima, however, is a common enough name in Portugal, and it is one of the great names
of Brazil.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_4.2" href="#div2Ref_4.2">Footnote 4.2</a>: When the town of Valladolid was first founded it
was either on or very near the east coast of Yucatan. The original foundation took
place about 1542; many years later the town was moved to its present location some
twenty-five miles to the southwest of Lake Suchen. In some of the old maps Valladolid
is indicated in such a way that one is perfectly justified in assuming that the
city was still at no great distance from the sea. Such maps as that of Blaauw (1667),
as that of Montanus (1671), as that of Vander Aa (1729), and that of Bellin (1764)
fall into this category. On the other hand the maps of Brion de la Tour (1783) and
of Lopez (1801) show Valladolid in approximately its present situation. We may safely
believe, then, that the move took place between 1764 and 1783, long after Cogolludo
wrote, and that therefore he had the first location in mind.</p>

1480, died 1552, was Viceroy of Mexico (New Spain) from 1535 to 1551. He established
the Bishopric of Michoacan in 1537 and from 1551 to 1552 was Viceroy of Peru. He
was a statesman of excellent qualities.</p>

<h4>Chapter V</h4>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_5.1" href="#div2Ref_5.1">Footnote 5.1</a>: Villagutierre&#39;s spelling of proper names and capitalization
are given in most cases.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_5.2" href="#div2Ref_5.2">Footnote 5.2</a>: Cogolludo adds some details concerning the mock embassy
of the Itzas to Merida which the account of Villagutierre lacks. Cogolludo says
(p. 472 ff.) that, in the time of Don Antonio de Figueroa, who was Governor of Yucatan
from August, 1612, to September, 1617, Yucatan enjoyed a goodly measure of prosperity,
which was interrupted in the following manner: &quot;... there came in the time of this
Governor [Figueroa] to the city of Merida some Itzaex Indians, saying that their
purpose was to give their obedience to the King and to the Governor in his name,
and he gave them staffs as Alcaldes, and appointed them a government, and they returned,
leaving him in the belief that they were voluntarily his subjects, but soon it was
all seen to be a trick. Now that it was known that the coming of those Indians had
no better end than this, in the reign of this Governor a great reduction of this
province was carried on, for many of the people of this Province were fugitives
in the Woodlands of Zahcabchen. By these, says the Bachiller Valencia in his relation,
were founded the Villages of San Antonio de Zahcabchen, San Lorenzo de Vlumal, Tzuctok,
Cauich, by a commission headed by Captain Francisco de Villalobos, his [Valencia&#39;s]
grandfather, who intended the reduction of these people....&quot;</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_5.3" href="#div2Ref_5.3">Footnote 5.3</a>: This was the Juan de Coronel who was the author of
an &quot;Arte en lengua de Maya&quot; published by Diego Garrido, Mexico, 1620. See Wilkinson
Sale Catalog, 1914, number 193.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_5.4" href="#div2Ref_5.4">Footnote 5.4</a>: A curious misuse of this word. The Caribs of the
West Indies were so ferocious that their name became proverbial as a synonym for
savagery; our own word &quot;cannibal&quot; is derived from it. Ancona says that the Caribs
actually made invasions into Yucatan (1878, vol. i, p. 29). The present Lacandones
are usually called Caribes by the Spanish population.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_5.5" href="#div2Ref_5.5">Footnote 5.5</a>: <i>Vecino</i> = citizen, i.e., freeholder. The non-freeholders
were not citizens in Spanish America.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_5.6" href="#div2Ref_5.6">Footnote 5.6</a>: The prophecies spoken of by Avendaño (pp. 22, 23)
are interesting. They are those of Patzin Yaxun, of Nahau Pec, of Ahkukil-Chel,
of Ahnupuc-Tun, and of Chilan-Balam, High-priest of Tixcacayoc Cabich in Mani. The
text of all of them is given by Villagutierre and by Cogolludo; translations appear
in Fancourt and many other places.</p>
<p class="hang3">We may believe that no matter when the events took place which
gave rise to the present versions of the prophecies, the versions themselves probably
grew up among the Itzas between 1524 and 1618, for, as we have seen, the Canek of
Cortes&#39;s day displayed no aversion to the proposed introduction of Christianity
among his subjects.</p>
<p class="hang3">It is not denied that a foundation in fact may have existed for
the belief that the seers of northern Yucatan foretold some calamity; the present
contention is merely that the prophecies which the Itzas had in mind when they told
Padre Fuensalida that the time for their conversion had not yet come were of comparatively
recent origin among them. The Catholic character of the phraseology is too obvious
to dwell upon.</p>
<p class="hang3">Cf. Villagutierre, p. 35 ff.; Cogolludo, p. 96 ff.; Fancourt,
1854, p. 57 ff.; Lizana, 1633, pt. ii, chap. i; Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858, vol.
ii, p. 603; Orozco y Berra, 1880, pp. 73-74; Carrillo y Ancona, 1883, pp. 523-606.</p>
<p class="hang3">It is impossible to pass over without remark the fact that Mr.
Maudslay, in a note at pages 34 and 35 of the last volume of his edition of Bernal
Diaz, creates a false impression of the reason why Padres Fuensalida and Orbita
left Tayasal. As the two last paragraphs of Maudslay&#39;s note stand they imply that
the Padres left Tayasal because of the hostility of the Indians caused by the breaking
of the idol of the horse. As a matter of fact this was not the reason. Rather, their
leaving was due to the fact that the Itzas refused to be baptized before the time
which they believed to be appointed for their conversion.</p>

same as that of Villagutierre y Sotomayor. He calls Zaclun &quot;Zacalum.&quot; This entrada

the Indians of Yucathan had books made of the bark of trees; over this was a white
cement which was perpetual, and these books were from ten to twelve varas long,
being doubled over and folded.... On these the Indians painted the accounts of their
years, wars, inundations, famines, hurricanes, and other events. From one of them,
which Dr. Aguilar took away from some Idolaters, it was learned that in ancient
times there was a plague called <i>Mayacimil</i> and also another called <i>Ocna Kuchil</i>,
which is to say Sudden Deaths, and Times-in-which-ravens-entered-the-houses-to-eat-the-corpses.
Inundation and hurricane they called <i>Hunyecil</i>, Overflowing-of-trees....</p>

<p class="hang3con">By this count the year was divided into eighteen months, but
their year began on the seventeenth of our July. The five days which were lacking
to complete the 365 were called Nameless Days. They held them to be melancholy,
and they said that on them happened disastrous deaths and unforeseen events, such
as stings and bites from poisonous snakes and wild or venomous animals as well as
quarrels and dissensions; and they especially feared the first of these days. During
this period they tried not to go out of their houses, and so they always provided
themselves with what was necessary beforehand so as not to have to go to the fields
or elsewhere. At this time they attended especially to their Heathen Rites, begging
their Idols to keep them free from harm in those dangerous days and to grant that
the following year might be fertile and abundant. And these days so greatly feared
were the 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 (sic) of our July. All the days of the month
had each its name, which I leave untold for fear of prolixity.</p>
<p class="hang3">&quot;By means of this count they know the time in which to clear the
woodlands and to burn the underbrush, to expect rains, to sow the Maize and other
vegetables, for all which actions they have their Proverbs. The first Religious
(says Aguilar), holy men, and true Keepers of the Vineyard of Jesus Christ, tried
to abolish this count, holding it to be superstitious, but they did not progress
far because most [of the Indians] know it. This matter was laid before a great and
Apostolic Man named Padre Solana, and before another scarcely less great called
Fray Caspar de Naxara, who were great Ministers and Preachers and who felt that
it was not prejudicial to the Christianizing of the Indians; but Padre Fuensalida
says in his Relacion, treating of the ancient counts: &#39;It would be far better in
every way if the Indians did not learn and know of the ancient peoples, because
they have been found still at their idolatries, and those who were converted to
our Holy Catholic Faith still perform the rites, adoring the Demon through thousands
of Idols which have been found in this Province.&#39; ...</p>
<p class="hang3">&quot;They counted their eras and ages which they put in their books
by groups of twenty years and by lustra of four years. The first year they fixed
in the East, calling it <i>Cuchhaab</i>; the second in the West, calling it <i>Hijx</i>; the
third in the South, <i>Cavac</i>; the fourth in the North, called <i>Muluc</i>.&quot; These refer
to the four dominical days, which he has given incorrectly. They should be Kan,
Muluc, Ix (Hijx), and Cauac. (See Bowditch, 1910, p. 278.) &quot;When these lustra reached
five, which is exactly twenty years, they called it a <i>Katun</i> and placed a carved
stone upon another, fixing them with lime and sand in the walls of their Temples
and the houses of their Priests, as is to be seen today in the edifices which have
been spoken of and in certain ancient walls of our Convent in Merida, over which
there are cells. In a village called Tixualahtun, which signifies Place-where-a-carved-stone-is-placed-upon-another,
it is said that there were Archives where were preserved all the events, as is done
in Spain at the Archivo de Simancas.</p>
<p class="hang3">&quot;The common way of counting their age was by these periods or
Katuns, as, for instance, to say &#39;I have sixty years&#39; <i>Oxppelvabil</i>--&#39;I have three
eras of age,&#39; that is, three stones; for seventy it is three and a half. Wherever
it was known that there were not too many barbarians, they continued to live by
this count, and it was said to be very accurate, so much so that not only did they
know with certainty of an event, but also of the day and month on which it took
place.&quot;</p>

<h4>Chapter X</h4>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_10.1" href="#div2Ref_10.1">Footnote 10.1</a>: This passage (Villagutierre, p. 315) is very important.
The question of the location of Dolores and of Lacandon, as well as that of their
identity, has long been a moot point. (Tozzer&#39;s introduction to Marjil, 1912.) The
main body of the Lacandones, as well Chol-speaking as Maya-speaking, lies southwest
of Lake Peten. (Cf. Tozzer, 1907.) That fact accounts for Costello&#39;s location of
Los Dolores southwest of the lake. (Fancourt, 1854, map.) On the map of our region
in Hazius and Lowitz&#39; Atlas of 1746 Lacandon and Los Dolores are located northwest
of the lake, whereas maps such as those of Bellin (1764) and Brion de la Tour (1783)
do not mention either, nor do they leave any territory southeast of the lake where
they might possibly be. In spite of these contradictions we need be in little doubt
as to the true location of Los Dolores del Lacandon, for as the expedition under
Paredes was marching southward, their left was to the east, and consequently they
were to march southeast from Tzucthok in order to reach Los Dolores. The Lacandones
have been shown to have existed in that region as well as in Chiapas. (Thomas, 1911,
p. 70 and map.) Therefore we may safely believe that Hendges (Map of Guatemala,
1902) is right in locating Los Dolores southeast of the lake. Further confirmation
of this belief lies in the fact that Mr. Morley found in the village of Dolores
three church bells dated 1718, which bear inscriptions that show they were intended
for the Church of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores en la Provincia del Yiza, i.e.,
the Dolores of which we speak.</p>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_10.2" href="#div2Ref_10.2">Footnote 10.2</a>: This is, of course, the same ambassador in whose
authenticity Avendaño, as we know, felt so much distrust. Something is known in
regard to this messenger. His full name was Don Martin Can, and he was a native
of Peten Grande, whose King was Canek. His father was Can, a native of Tipu; his
mother was Cante, sister of Canek. His father, stung by a serpent, had long been
dead; his mother, of whom he had heard it said that she came from Chichen Itza,
had also been dead a long time. He was baptized Martin a year before in Merida,
and, though he did not know exactly, he thought he was about thirty years old. He
was married to an Indian girl named Coboh, who lived in Alain. Canek had sent him
and three other Indians of Alain to Merida with an embassy and with a crown of plumes
as homage, to ask for Padres to come and enlighten the Indians as to the True God.
Having passed from Alain he had arrived at Tipu, where the Muzules Indians had wished
to join him, and although he knew them to be mere savages, he took them with him.
All sorts of food and drink, as well as a house, had been made ready for the Padres
who should go to Alain. He had then gone to Merida and had been most cordially received
by Ursua. His baptism had taken place and he had delivered his message, receiving
in return many presents for Canek and for himself. After taking leave of Don Martin
de Ursua, Can and his companions, together with Hariza and the Padres, had returned
to Tipu, where they stayed two weeks until, on account of the opposition of the
Cacique Zima, Can fled to Alain, leaving the present for Canek in the hands of Hariza.
Arrived in Alain, Can was told by Chamaxculu, the Cacique, that many of the Indians
had rebelled against Canek, killing many of the Spaniards. He himself was the object
of the Indians&#39; hatred on account of his conversion. He took refuge in the small
Peten of Motzkal until he was sent for by Canek, his uncle. He told how trenches
and walls of stones had been built at Peten Grande. Both the King Canek and the
chief priest Kincanek were now in Peten ready to defend it against the Spaniards
who had injured them. The Cacique of Alain, Chamaxculu, wished, with his people,
to be Christianized.</p>

<h4>Appendix II</h4>
<p class="hang1"><a name="div2_A2.1" href="#div2Ref_A2.1">Footnote A2.1</a>: To judge by the haphazard way in which the words
and phrases contained in the MS. are set down, and taking into consideration the
informal nature of the MS. itself, this vocabulary was intended by Dr. Berendt merely
to act as a field glossary and phrase book. Despite its incompleteness and formlessness,
however, it is of value for us because it is the only known glossary of the Itza
dialect.</p>
